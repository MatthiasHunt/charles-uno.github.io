Spoilers ahead.

In the first episode, we see the bakers' innate/prior skill. They don't really know what it'll be like under the tent.

By the time the second episode rolls around, they know what they're in for, and who they're competing against.

Seems fair to say that we're not testing innate baking ability, but ability to bake under pressure.

Note that [Series 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off_(series_1)) is left off because it's not formatted the same. There are fewer episodes, and in the first episode, only the best and worst technical ranks are listed off; those in the middle are not listed.

Data comes from Wikipedia. I have not checked it... though, reading through it, it is consistent with my recollection.

Data points are offset slightly to avoid overlap.

*Caption... and note that the R<sup>2</sup> value doubles if we leave off season 2, which has that bizarre anticorrelation.*
