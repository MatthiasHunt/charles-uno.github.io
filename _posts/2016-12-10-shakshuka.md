Preheat your oven to 425Â°F. 

Roast bell peppers open-side-down until the skin puffs and blackens, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven. Once cool, remove and discard the skins. Dice the peppers and set them aside.

In the meantime, start the onions with some olive oil in a large skillet. Cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes. The onions should reduce in size by about half and begin to caramelize.

Add the roasted peppers to the skillet. Add the spices to the skillet. Stir until fragrant, about a minute. Then add the tomatoes. Stir to combine, bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low.

Press the feta cubes gently into the sauce. Then use a spoon to create six divots and crack an egg into each. Cover the skillet and simmer until the egg whites are set, about 10 minutes.

Enjoy promptly with bread. Serves four.
