The senate exists "so big states don't bully small states," right? But that's not a real thing. Has it ever been?

If we're going to give special rights to one group in the US, why is it rural whites, who (1) are a big enough voting bloc to look out for themselves, and (2) have shitty priorities, specifically racism
I guess "big states bullying small states" probably is code for "voting to abolish slavery"?



[Charles C W Cooke writes](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/senate-hasnt-skewed-supreme-court-to-right/):

"""Provided that federal power remains in check, the Senate prevents no state from enacting whichever policies it wishes to within its border; it merely prevents a handful of states from riding roughshod over their smaller counterparts on those few questions that are inherently national. Thus was the republic deliberately arranged."""

In practice, the overrepresentation of small states has been used to prevent the Senate from ensuring the rights of minorities. 




Weekly Sift's Doug Muder crunches the numbers.

1790 (first) census. VA: 450k, 21 EV. DE: 50k, 3 EV. 9-to-1 population, 7-to-1 EV.
2010 census. CA: 37M, 55 EV. WY: 560k, 3 EV. 66-to-1 population, 18-to-1 EV.

Similar numbers from WaPo. Based on 2012, 2014, 2016 Senate elections, GOP got 102M votes (51 seats) to Dems' 117M votes (49 seats). 

2016: 40M R, 47M D
2014: 22M R, 20M D
2012: 39M R, 50M D
2010: 33M R, 29M D
2008: 30M R, 34M D
2006: 27M R, 34M D

Senate flipped in 2014. 

2010 + 2012 + 2014:  94M R,  99M D
2012 + 2014 + 2016: 102M R, 117M D

2014 + 2016: 62M R, 67M D

Not clear what the vote totals will look like in 2018, but GOP is very unlikely to outvote Dems by 5M, also not particularly likely to lose the Senate

Maybe it would be ok to have it as the less powerful chamber, for friction, but it's far more powerful than the house, and laughably unrepresentative

Maybe Jesse Ventura was on to something when he tried to make MN unicameral

I had other points to make last night, but failed to write them down before going to bed... Need to percolate more

Sift also points out: KY was formed from a chunk of VA, and VT from NH/NY.

At the end of the 18th century, state and national borders were very much still in flux.

France did a lot of consolidating around that same time.

France, Italy, and central Europe all in flux through the 18th century.

(And the US was as well, of course. AZ and NM didn't join the union until 100 years ago, and AK and HI until after WWII.)

"big states bullying small states" -- what exactly would that look like? (Spoiler: what it actually *did* look like: abolishing slavery)

Agricultural subsidies? CA is a major farm state, just like IA.

Slavery a consideration in the second amendment.
