From the CARS angle.

Cars are extremely dangerous. Despite numerous safety features (and drivers' best intentions), about 33k Americans die each year in automobile accidents. Over 2k of them are children under the age of 16.

About a third are attributable to drunk drivers.

License, registration, insurance. Measure of those?

Analogous to background checks? Pretty much anyone can get a drivers license. But if you drive drunk, they might take it away from you.

Car ownership, while not constitutionally protected, is culturally and economically important.

Government denies license to drive only in extreme cases. Drunk drivers, people who fail vision tests. In some states, that's not true...

- Massachusetts requires that firearms are kept "secured in a locked container or equipped with a tamper-resistant mechanical lock or other safety device." Nationwide, 39% of youth suicides involve a gun; in MA, it's 9%. The stateâ€™s youth suicide death rate is 35% below the national average.
- A 2015 study found that 75% of Americans (including nearly 60% of gun owners) support licensing. And almost everyone supports universal background checks.
- Almost 400k guns are stolen per year, 20k of them from dealers.
- Missouri scrapped its permit-to-purchase law, which required all handgun purchasers to obtain a licence confirming they had passed a background check. Controlling for changes in poverty, unemployment, crime, incarceration, policing levels and other factors, they found that the repeal was associated with a 23% increase in gun homicide rates.

(1) Extremely frustrating that the right will not acknowledge any link between guns and gun deaths, and in fact proposes MORE GUNS as a solution to gun deaths. More guns correlate with more gun deaths if you sort by country, by state, and even by household.

[20% of mass shootings are preceded by a domestic dispute](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44126.pdf) -- this source is actually much broader




Very frustrating that the response from the right is always a defense of the status quo. DF acknowledges that mass shootings are real, but also thinks they're unsolvable. I have not yet seen him acknowledge that ~100 Americans are killed each day by guns, 99% of them unrelated to mass shootings.




The left is brainstorming solutions to gun violence, some better than others. It's infuriating that the right refuses to participate. Each of DF's articles is a defense of the status quo -- some of them explicitly so. He acknowledges that mass shootings are real, but thinks they are unsolvable (or, perhaps, can be solved with more guns).

There's no acknowledgement that ~80 Americans are killed by guns each day, 99% of them unrelated to mass shooters. He talks about guns as a self-defense tool even though a gun in the house makes children measurably more likely to be fatally shot. There's no admission that a handful of different state-level models have been successful at reducing gun deaths. And he's supposed to be the reasonable right!

It seems like for half the country, civilian gun ownership is about (1) the culture war, and/or (2) a mythological retelling of the 2A. The reality of thousands of preventable gun deaths isn't even part of the conversation.

Like the Dickey Amendment. The CDC found in the 90s that guns are dangerous. Now they're not allowed to study guns' effect on public health. That's insane. It's also illegal to keep electronic records of gun ownership, so the feds have to use microfilm.

How do you engage with that? Do any prominent figures on the right break from the party line of unregulated civilian gun ownership?









Arming teachers is pretty sketchy on its face -- teachers have plenty of responsibilities without being asked to kill a troubled child -- and also carries racial baggage. How long until an 18 year old black kid mouths off aggressively, or shoves a teacher, and gets shot? What happens when an open-carrying black teacher gets pulled over?



(2) Also frustrating that the right to own guns is considered by many to be inalienable.

People are OK with restrictions on weapons of war, but somehow don't consider guns to fall into the same category.

look at cigarettes, cars

the solution isn't confiscation -- good luck getting that through the courts. it's a cultural shift. legislation is a part of that.

- cigarette companies no longer allowed to advertise to kids, no longer "cool"
- no smoking inside restaurants
- tax on cigarettes to mitigate the public cost of chronic health conditions

analogous for guns would be

- restrict the marketing of "cool" gun-toting protagonists to kids
- limitations on where you can bring guns
- tax on guns/bullets to mitigate the public cost -- fund police/hospitals


Wild-west dystopian fantasy world where people routinely repel armed home invaders or face off against military or police.

waiting periods for abortion try to price women out of getting them at all. restrictions on abortion clinics try to get them to close down. that's simply not a risk for guns. you can buy a gun at Walmart. a waiting period, or whatever, doesn't cost you much.

- If you have a gun, everybody in your home is more likely than your non-gun-owning neighbors and their families to die in a gun-related accident, suicide or homicide. [Source](https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/12/health-risk-having-gun-home)

Gun laws stop at state lines but guns don't. IL has strict gun laws, but more than half of the guns used to commit crimes there were bought in WI or IN (which have lax gun laws). It's not just retailers -- lax gun laws just mean more guns around to buy online or steal. [Source](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-laws-stop-at-state-lines-but-guns-dont/)


Guns are rarely used in self-defense. Most purported self-defense gun uses are actually illegal escalations of arguments. Guns are used far more often to intimidate family members than in self-defense. Self-defense gun use is rare and not more effective at preventing injury than other protective actions.

In about 75% of gun homicides, the killer already knows the victim. Less than 10% of violent victimizations in the home were committed by strangers. [Source](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/vvcs9310.pdf)

The NRA likes to claim, "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." It's complete malarkey: fewer than 1% of gun deaths in the US are justifiable homicides, and fewer than 1% of crimes are stopped by a law-abiding citizen with a gun.

Most firearm deaths have nothing to do with "bad guys." Of the 32k yearly gun deaths in this country, 20k are suicides. State-by-state, suicide rate corresponds strongly with gun ownership. Suicide is an impulsive act, and a nearby gun (unlike pills, etc) makes that act nearly certain to succeed.

Furthermore, of the 12k yearly gun homicides, 75% involve a killer who already knows the victim. Guns are used to escalate arguments and threaten intimates far more often than they are used to perpetrate random acts of crime or violence.

Children pay the price for America's obsession with guns. On average in the US, seven children are fatally shot (and another 20 are nonfatally shot) per day. The US makes up 25% of the population of the developed world, but accounts for 75% of children murdered with guns.

John -- Most firearm deaths have nothing to do with drug cartels or gang bangers. Of the 32k yearly gun deaths, 20k are suicides. State-by-state, suicide rate corresponds strongly with gun ownership. Suicide is an impulsive act, and (unlike pills, etc) a nearby gun makes that act nearly certain to succeed.

Furthermore, of the 12k yearly gun homicides, only 25% (3k) involved a killer who did not already know the victim. Guns are used to escalate arguments and threaten intimates far more often than they are used to perpetrate random acts of crime or violence.

Guns seem like an effective tool for protection and crime deterrence, and it's easy to come up with anecdotes about lives saved by them. But the numbers are pretty clear: places with lots of guns -- legal or not -- are also places with lots of gun deaths.

Scott -- See page 8 of the VPC report linked above. In 0.8% of violent crimes, and 0.1% of property crimes, the victim respond by threatening or attacking with a firearm. The data comes from the FBI's yearly violent crime report.

You could make an argument that a culture of gun ownership deters crime. That may hold some truth: compared to the US, the UK has few guns, and significantly more petty crime. The tradeoff is, muggers in the UK are mostly unarmed, and our gun homicide rate is **quadruple** theirs.
