This recipe is large -- it makes about 6 liters of soup (a gallon and a half). If you're not cooking for a fundraiser, half everything.

In a large, deep pan, start **600ml of chopped bacon** (a pound) low and slow, rendering out as much fat as possible. When the bacon is just about done, add **1800ml diced onion** (7 cups) and stir to coat the onions in the bacon grease. Increase the heat and season heavily with **black pepper** and **rosemary**. Cook, stirring intermittently, until the onions reduce by half.

*The vegetables will cook way down, and the wild rice and lentils will cook way up!*

Pour in **4000ml broth** and **4000ml water** (2 quarts of each)[^1], then stir in **500ml dry wild rice**, **500ml dry red lentils** (2 cups each), and **900ml chopped carrots** and **900ml chopped celery** (3.5 cups each).

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Boil uncovered, stirring once in a while, until the rice and lentils are cooked and the carrots are soft. This should take about an hour.

[^1]: The broth-to-water ratio can be adjusted to taste. More broth means more flavor, but too much can make the wild rice stubborn about cooking through. This may have to do with acidity.

Shortly before serving, stir in **1800ml chopped kale**. Within about a minute, the kale should soften and its color should become notably brighter.

*The resulting stew is quite thick, since the lentils and wild rice soak up most of the broth as they cook.*

This stew is great for leftovers -- it's dense and it reheats well. It's even pretty healthy!
