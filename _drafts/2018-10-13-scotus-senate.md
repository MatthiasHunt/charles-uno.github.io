America's founders created the House of Representatives to give the people a voice in the federal government. Seats in the House are allocated proportionally, and representatives are elected frequently to ensure accountability to the electorate. That said, the founders showed little confidence in the House's ability to govern responsibly. Madison wrote in the Federalist [#62](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa62.htm) that such a body would be unstable due to the electorate's "sudden and violent passions."

The Senate was presented as a stabilizing force. Unlike representatives, senators were to be professional politicians, insulated from the electorate by indirect[^1] and infrequent elections. More than one founder considered that the Senate might resemble a hereditary aristocracy. [Dickinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dickinson) suggested that senators be "[distinguished for their rank in life and their weight of property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Senate#cite_note-3)." Madison wrote in Federalist [#63](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa63.htm) that, because the Senate couldn't enact laws on its own, at least it would not become a *tyrannical* aristocracy.

[^1]: Senators have been directly elected since the 17th Amendment in 1913. They are still insulated from electorate by six-year terms. In fact, senators now serve [longer](https://www.ifweassume.com/2015/01/how-long-do-senators-actually-serve.html) on average than they did before the 17th Amendment.

Two centuries later, the Senate still has an aristocratic feel to it. Compared to the House, it's half as diverse and twice as wealthy[^2]. Such a highly-enfranchised body is well-equipped to navigate conflicts between states, or ratify international treaties; voters (and their representatives in the House) are unlikely to have expertise in matters so far removed from day-to-day life. But, by the same token, the Senate is uniquely *ill*-equipped for the consideration of civil rights. When evaluating the complaints of the powerless against the abuses of the powerful, a room full of aristocrats is not impartial.

[^2]: The Senate is [10% nonwhite](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/24/115th-congress-sets-new-high-for-racial-ethnic-diversity/), compared to 22% for the House and [38%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States) for the US overall. The median senator's net worth is [about $1M](https://www.rollcall.com/news/hawkings/congress-richer-ever-mostly-top), compared to $400k for the median representative in the House.

The Senate filibuster is [well known](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Filibuster_Cloture.htm) for blocking civil rights legislation passed by the House. Even worse is the Senate's indirect influence over civil rights via judicial appointments. All federal judges, including the justices of the Supreme Court, are confirmed by the Senate, with no input from the House. These judges -- hand-picked by the Senate aristocracy -- are the final arbiters of what constitutes disenfranchisement, and whether [or not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County_v._Holder) protections are appropriate.

When the founders entrusted the Senate with judicial appointments, they couldn't have anticipated how important courts would be in the advancement of civil rights. Slavery was a divisive issue at the time, but it was addressed by Congress through the lens of states rights rather than individual rights[^3]. The [Reconstruction Amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Amendments) following the Civil War turned that paradigm on its head. They established the federal government's constitutional responsibility to ensure the rights of its citizens, even if their state would rather see them disenfranchised. Along with the principle of judicial review, as established in [Marbury v Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison) (1803), these amendments demanded that federal courts strike down discriminatory executive orders and acts of Congress.

[^3]: See, for example, the [Missouri Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Compromise) (1820) and the [Kansas-Nebraska Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansasâ€“Nebraska_Act) (1854).

The courts have been deeply involved in civil rights for well over a century[^4]. Landmark decisions like [Plessy v Ferguson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson) (1896) and [Brown v Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education) (1954) carry just as much weight as any act of Congress. But, often, courts have found themselves on the wrong side of history. In fact, all four of the worst[^5] Supreme Court decisions in history relate to civil rights:

[^4]: Early civil rights cases heard by SCOTUS include [Dred Scott v Sandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford) (1857), [Strauder v West Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauder_v._West_Virginia) (1880), the [Civil Rights Cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Cases) (1883), and [Plessy v Ferguson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson) (1896).

[^5]: "Worst" is subjective, but there seems to be widespread agreement that these four are at the top of the list.

- In [Dred Scott v Sandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford) (1857), SCOTUS voted 7-2 that persons of African descent cannot be US citizens, and thus have no standing to sue in federal court. This decision essentially stripped rights from the [half-million](https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/free-blacks-1619-1860) free Blacks living in the US at the time.
- In [Plessy v Ferguson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson) (1896), they voted 7-1 to endorse the doctrine of "separate but equal," opening the door to racially segregated housing, schooling, and transportation. Millions of African Americans were adversely affected throughout the 20th century.
- In [Buck v Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_v._Bell) (1927), SCOTUS voted 8-1 to allow forced sterilization of the "feeble minded" and "promiscuous". State laws resulted in the surgical sterilization of [over 60k Americans](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/united-states-once-sterilized-tens-thousands-heres-how-supreme-court-allowed) Americans, and disproportionately women of color.
- In [Korematsu v US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korematsu_v._United_States) (1944), SCOTUS voted 6-3 to allow FDR's incarceration of Japanese Americans, including US citizens, for the duration of WWII. Over 100k people were forcibly relocated, robbed of their homes and businesses.

In each case above, the Supreme Court erred on the side of the powerful, rather than defending the rights of the powerless.
