Valakut is a good deck for a newcomer to Modern. All your cards are basically lands. Just keep putting them on the table and eventually your opponent will scoop up their cards. Half the time you don't even have to care what they're playing!

This isn't meant as criticism. The first Modern tournament I ever played was a PPTQ. I won it with Valakut, despite knowing nothing about the format. Then I won the RPTQ, flew to Spain, and went 6-4 in the Modern portion of PT RIX. 

The deck's not bad. And resolving Primeval Titan is a rush. But there just aren't that many choices -- it could basically be played by a computer.
