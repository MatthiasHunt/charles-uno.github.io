In a large skillet, start **800 mL garbanzo beans** (28oz, two cans) on high heat with a splash of **olive oil**. Stir intermittently until the beans start to brown, about 5 minutes.

*A good use for a lot of kale!*

Turn the heat down to medium and add **500 mL chopped onion** (a medium onion) and **500 mL chunked sausage links** (2 large links). Go for a sausage with strong flavor, and not too lean; as the fat renders out of the sausage, it'll season the rest of the dish.

Cook the sausage through, then add **1 L chopped kale** (8 cups). This will seem like way too much, and likely overflow your skillet. It should take just a few minutes for the kale to cook down. Its color should also become visibly brighter.
