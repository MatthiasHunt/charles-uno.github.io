the government does not spend tax dollars on programs. it prints dollars, then taxes them back

so why tax? to avoid too much money in circulation. trying to have the "right" number of dollars

the "right" number of dollars changes over time. population growth, increased productivity due to technology, plus trade with other countries means there are lots of dollars sitting around overseas. (this is good. it means we bought things. and it also means other countries like the dollar)

if it's printed out of nothing, why does the dollar have value? because taxes have to be paid in dollars.

The US government can print as many dollars as it needs to honor its promises. It can never default on its obligations as long as those obligations are denominated in US dollars.

Political problem, not economic problem. Congress has to authorize payments.

Taxation destroys dollars. Reduces the amount of money in circulation. Redistribution.

Taxing in dollars makes the dollar valuable. Property taxes, sales taxes, etc. All must be paid in dollars. Those dollars only come (untimately) from the US government. If you don't pay your taxes, you go to jail.

Deficit is a measure of the number of dollars (and US Treasury bonds) in circulation. It's not borrowed. It does not need to be paid back.

If there's slack in the economy, that means the federal government isn't printing (aka spending) enough dollars. High unemployment for example. The US government can spend money to create jobs (directly or indirectly).

Printing too many dollars, or spending them poorly, can lead to inflation. For example, if the US government wants to fund a bunch of construction housing projects during a housing boom, there won't be enough workers to do it all. Government contracts and private contracts will compete, driving up prices. That's inflation.
