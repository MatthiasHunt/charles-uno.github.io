This one is optimized for cooking with toddlers/preschoolers. Lots of fun things to measure. Minimal dishes. Very forgiving.

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 2 eggs (or equivalent [egg substitute](https://www.bobsredmill.com/gluten-free-vegan-egg-replacer.html))
- 0.5 cup room temperature butter (1 stick) or avocado oil
- 0.5 cup dark brown sugar
- 0.5 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 0.5 cup seeds (white sesame, black sessame, chia, and/or poppy)
- 0.5 cup dark chocolate chips
- *roughly* 0.5 cup water, milk, or almond milk

Amount of water/milk depends on how the flour was measured!
