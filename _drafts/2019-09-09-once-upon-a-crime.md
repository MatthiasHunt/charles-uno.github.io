When Mark Rosewater [previewed](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/eldraine-or-shine-2019-09-09) [[Once Upon a Time]], eyebrows went up. Free stuff and efficient cantrips both have a history of ending up on the Modern banned list. This one in particular looks a lot like [[Ancient Stirrings]], a card which [was recently acknowledged](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-21-2019-banned-and-restricted-announcement) as potentially bannable.

Since then, I've simulated[^1] tens of thousands of opening hands over a handful of different archetypes.

Having now simulated tens of thousands of hands across a handful of different archetypes, I can say with confidence: [[Once Upon a Time]] is not a fair card. If it doesn't get banned, it'll be a format staple. 


## Tron

Tron, the primary Ancient Stirrings deck, is getting the biggest buzz. 













the concern is justified. 

[[Once Upon a Time]] is an unfair card. 




basically the same numbers if you play it in addition to scrying, stirrings


in tron, it isn't competing with Stirrings. It's competing with Scrying.
