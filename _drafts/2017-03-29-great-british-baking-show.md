After watching the first episode of the Great British Bake Off, you might think you have a sense for which bakers are at the top (and bottom) of the pile.

In Series 4 (Season 2[^1]), for example, Ruby is reduced to tears after curdling her crème pâtissière in the first signature challenge. Then, in the first technical challenge, she botches her angel food cake so badly that she has to start over -- then runs out of time. She's saved from elimination only because Toby mixes up salt and sugar.

[^1]: Due to copyright issues, the BBC's Great British *Bake Off* is broadcast in the US as the Great British *Baking Show*. The seasons are also shuffled. Series 5 is on Netflix as Season 1; Series 4 is Season 2; etc.

As it turns out, the first episode tells us very little about how the season will progress. If we compare first-episode technical rank against the number of episodes each baker survives, we get [Rexthor](https://xkcd.com/1725/). Some of the first episode's top technical bakers make it all the way to the finals, while others are eliminated early in the season. There's no particular correlation.

*Data comes from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off_(series_1)). Points are plotted at a slight offset from the lattice points to improve legibility. Series 1 and 2 are omitted due to having a different number of episodes.*

Admittedly, our data set isn't great. Signature challenges and showstoppers are not scored numerically, and the banter between the hosts and judges is dramatically vague. We're comparing technical rank and episode count, ultimately, because those are the numbers we have.

But even considering the kludgey data, the lack of correlation is surprising. We intuitively expect the worst bakers to be eliminated early in the season. And we expect the best bakers to perform well in the technical challenges. In the first week, those expectations do not line up with the numbers.

In the second week, they do.

To me, this was a surprise. I had expected to see that some bakers are fundamentally better than others, and that the difference would be evident from the start of the season.

This is interesting because, as each season progresses, it's apparent to the viewer than some bakers *are* better than others.

Chetna and Kimberley deliver consistent, interesting flavors.

- good bake
- novel presentation
- exciting flavors

Norman and Glenn ... and Beca? were clearly getting outclassed.

working hard, but still near the bottom of the pack. less consistent, but also less ambitious.

were clearly getting outclassed -- performing poorly

It turns out, that's not the case. At the start of Series 4, the top technical bakers are Rob and Lucy -- both of whom are eliminated in the first half of the season.

This is not to say that the eliminations are random (they're not), or that technical challenges don't matter (they do), or even that all the bakers are equally good (they're not).

As each season progresses, stratification becomes evident. Some bakers are clearly better.

As the season progresses, some bakers tend to do better than others.

This indicates to me that performance in the competition is not based on a baker's intrinsic abilities.

how well they can perform after scoping out the competition, getting a feel for the judges

Intrinsic baking ability versus ability to adapt to the landscape of the competition


Seems fair to say that we're not testing innate baking ability, but ability to bake under pressure.
