Mostly an affirmative case for why Biden is good, with some brief comparisons to Trump.

I am voting for Joe Biden. 

My goal here is to show, concretely, why.

If your priorities are anything like mine, I believe you should too.

Generally on the right side of issues. Pretty good at getting things done.

## What About Third Parties?

The two-party system is baked into our first-past-the-post voting system. Ross Perot won almost 20% of the vote in 1992, but did not earn a single electoral vote. 


## Age

Biden is older than dirt.
Second term comes with a decent risk of a major health complication

- Kamala Harris is competent. Ideologically similar to Biden. Has been deeply involved in the administration's major accomplishments.
- Still seems pretty sharp. Sometimes misspeaks (potentially related to a lifelong stutter). But listen to recent interviews and speeches. He's sharp. He knows what's going on. 

- Democrats held a primary to decide whether or not to replace Biden with an "average Democrat". Dean Phillips was a perfectly respectable choice: 55 years old, successful businessman, three terms in the House of Representatives, successfully flipped a red district.

Trump is also older than dirt.


## The Economy

Biden's COVID stimulus package was [generous][g20_stimulus_comparison], and he followed it up with a [big infrastructure bill][iija].
All that spending seems to have paid off.
The USA experienced a [smoother post-Covid recovery than other wealthy nations][post_covid_gdp]: lower unemployment, slower inflation, and faster GDP growth.
[Wages are rising][wage_growth], especially for [low-income workers][low_income_wages]. 
Income inequality is [falling][income_inequality_falling]. 

That all said, it's easy to give the president [too much credit][potus_economy] for the economy.
Markets crashed in 2020 because of COVID, not because of Trump.

## Signature Legislation

Biden passed several significant bills despite a fifty-fifty tie in the Senate:

- [American Rescue Plan][arp] - $1,900 billion COVID stimulus. 
- [Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act][iija] (bipartisan) - $1,200 billion to modernize roads, bridges, broadband, public transit, etc.
- [Inflation Reduction Act][ira] - $500 billion for clean energy (the largest ever climate bill). This spending was offset by an [estimated $700 billion][ira_cbo] in corporate tax hikes and IRS crackdowns on wealthy tax cheats.
- [CHIPs and Science Act][chips] (bipartisan) - $300 billion for domestic high-tech manufacturing and supply chains.
- [Safer Communities Act][biden_gun_control] (bipartisan) - $10 billion for school safety, first responders, crisis intervention programs, etc. This bill also expanded background checks, red flag rules, etc. It's the first gun safety law in nearly 30 years.

Trump had a larger majority in Congress than Biden, but he did less with it:

- [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act][tcja] - $1,500 billion in tax cuts which [mostly benefited high-income households and corporations][tcja_impact].
- [CARES Act][cares] (bipartisan) - $2,200 billion COVID stimulus.

## Israel and Palestine

<!--
First, a quick summary of [the world's most intractable conflict](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3965270):

Antisemitism in Europe induced large-scale Jewish immigration to the Middle East beginning in the 1800s. A Jewish state was proposed by Britain during WWI, then accepted by the UN following WWII. Arab states refused to recognize Israel. 
After some wars, Israel was left occupying the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank, both occupied by Arabs.
Relations have since normalized between Israel and [several Arab states][arab_states_recognize_israel]
Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank

[arab_states_recognize_israel]: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/15/map-which-mena-countries-have-diplomatic-ties-with-israel

Maybe Biden is [playing the long game][netanyahu_long_game], laying the groundwork for a lasting peace after Hamas and Likud are [out of power][dems_israel_elections].


Conspiracy theories. 

Easy to see Netanyahu align with Putin, as another right-wing leader happy to encroach on its neighbors. This would be very bad for the USA. Israel has been deeply entangled in US intelligence operations since 9-11. Israel also has NATO-level access to US military technology. 
Vetoed some stern letters from the UN, usually because he wants to see more blame pointed at Hamas.

"From the river to the sea" is literally calling for the destruction of Israel! 

-->

Hamas has been engaged in "[asymmetric warfare][hamas_goals]" against Israel for decades: [suicide bombers][wiki_hamas], [human shields][hamas_tunnels_not_bunkers], [sexual violence][hamas_rape], etc. 
Last October saw Hamas's largest attack yet: 1,000+ Israelis killed and hundreds more taken hostage.
Israel responded by invading Gaza to eradicate Hamas.
Over [30,000 have been killed][gaza_casualties], mostly Palestinian civilians.
Gaza's infrastructure has been devastated.
It's a humanitarian crisis.

Biden is trying to strike a balance:

- On one hand, Biden has Israel's right to defend itself.
  He sent billions of dollars in arms.
  He also vetoed some stern letters from the UN because they were not sufficiently critical of Hamas.
- On the other, he has the civilians in Gaza. 
  Biden brokered a [ceasefire in November][gaza_ceasefire_2023], and is [pursuing another][ceasefire_work_2024].
  He has repeatedly urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties, even threatening to [withhold arms][rafah_arms].
  He [built a temporary port][gaza_port] off Gaza for faster delivery of humanitarian aid. 
  He's pushing for [Palestinian statehood][palestinian_statehood] as part of a postwar plan.

I think his balance is off.
The scale of this conflict has been clear for months.
He should have been quicker to draw the [red line][rafah_arms].
But let's be clear-eyed about the alternative.
Trump's record on Palestine is horrific, and shows no interest in balance:

- Trump [withdrew US support][trump_peace_plan] for a two-state solution. 
- Trump endorsed further [Israeli settlements][trump_peace_plan] on occupied land.
- Trump [halted humanitarian aid][trump_halted_aid] to Gaza.
- Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing decades of precedent. The status of Jerusalem is a long-standing obstacle to peace.
- Trump blocked [immigration][trump_muslim_ban] and [refugee resettlement][trump_refugees] from Muslim nations.

## Labor and Unions

Biden is strongly pro-union. 
His NLRB appointees have made it [easier for workers to organize][nlrb]. 
He secured paid leave for rail workers.
Union membership is up, and 2023 was the biggest year for strikes in decades.

## Russia and Ukraine

Russia invaded and annexed Ukraine in 201x
At the time, Obama failed to enforce a red line

Biden has been much better
- Led western response. convinced Germany to cancel a Russian oil pipeline
- Clear guardrails to prevent direct conflict between nuclear powers
- Spending. Basically sending a bunch of old leftover supplies in exchange for clobbering our geopolitical adversary. zero American lives

Trump wanted to cut funding for Ukraine. Held up for months by Trump-aligned legislators


## The Middle East

95% decrease in drone strikes compared to Trump
