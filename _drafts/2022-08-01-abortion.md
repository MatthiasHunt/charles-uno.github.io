Imagine the government showing up at your door and asking for one of your kidneys.
They tell you that your kidney will save a child's life.
Due to genetic factors, you're the only possible donor.
Also, if you refuse, you'll go to prison.

I hope we can agree that this situation would be outrageous.
Donating a kidney is pretty safe[^1], but that's not really the point.
It's about bodily autonomy.
Using coercive power to take control of someone else's body is the stuff of nightmares.

[^1]: The mortality rate for kidney donors is about 1 in 5k, though [estimates][kidney_mortality_1] [vary][kidney_mortality_2]. Donors are advised to avoid strenuous physical activity for [a month or two][donor_recovery] after the operation. Life expectancy is [not adversely affected][kidney_life_expectancy].

And yet, abortion restrictions are just that.
By preventing a woman from terminating her pregnancy, the government is hijacking her bodily functions for the benefit of the fetus.
It doesn't matter that carrying a pregnancy to term is pretty safe[^2].
It doesn't matter if you believe the fetus is a person.
Just as the government isn't entitled to your kidney to save a life, it's also not entitled to a woman's womb.
Forcing a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy is a direct violation of her bodily autonomy.

[^2]: The mortality rate for carrying a pregnancy to term (including delivery) is about [1 in 5k][pregnancy_mortality]. Pregnancy also increases the woman's long-term risk for [adverse][c_section_chronic_pain] [conditions][pregnancy_long_term_effects]. And even a healthy pregnancy carries a large physical cost: nausea, weight gain, reduced mobility, [joint loosening][joint_loosening], and so on.

Things get a bit dicey if the fetus is viable[^3].
Bodily autonomy includes the right to stop being pregnant, but the woman may still have an obligation to deliver the fetus into medical care.
Importantly, [Roe v Wade][roe_v_wade] does not apply to such cases.
The 1973 Supreme Court ruling (and [1992 revision][pp_v_casey]) specifically protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy prior to viability.
Or at least it did, until it was [overturned in 2022][dobbs].

[^3]: A full-term pregnancy is 37 to 40 weeks. Fetuses born as early as [24 weeks][fetal_viability] can sometimes survive with intensive medical care.







Roe v Wade was overturned in the 2022 ruling [Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization][dobbs].
Several states [banned abortion immediately][abortion_bans_by_state].




when dobbs stripped women of their right to abortion, it devalued their bodily autonomy
there are other consequences to that




Women in those states lost the right to end their pregnancies

In those states, the government hijacked the bodies of pregnant women to




obvious hit to bodily autonomy
but also non-obvious side effects

Donating a kidney is invasive and inconvenient, but remarkably safe.
Post-op recovery lasts [about a month][donor_recovery], and after that there are generally no ill effects.
Kidney donors have about the same [life expectancy][kidney_life_expectancy] as the general public, and fatal complications are exceptionally rare (about 1 in 5000).
For the recipient, on the other hand, kidney donation is a matter of life and death.
Dialysis only works for a few years.
[Thousands of Americans die each year][donation_stats] due to a shortage of organ donors.

Despite the relative stakes, organ donation in the USA is [strictly voluntary][donation_requires_consent].
The government cannot force you to donate a kidney under any circumstances --- even if you are the only possible donor, even to save the life of your child, and even if you had [previously agreed][donor_can_change_mind] to donate.
Bodily autonomy is a fundamental human right.
Government organ hijacking is an egregious violation of that right, regardless of any supposed "greater good".

But laws restricting abortion are exactly that.
The government is overruling a woman's bodily autonomy.
It's hijacking her uterus for the benefit of a third party.


rape exception - who certifies the rape?

Only [about half of Americans][organ_donor_rate] are registered as organ donors.

Plus: criminalizing abortion comes with barbaric side effects.

TODO: Estimate of rates before roe v wade

Catholic church tolerates abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy. Fetus grows in the fallopian tube instead of the womb. Dangerous for both -- but there are recorded cases of both surviving birth. Scholarly tradition. They have to admit that biology is complicated.

"life begins at conception" has trouble with TWINS
