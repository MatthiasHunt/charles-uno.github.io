For the bulk of the 20th century, bipartisan majorities in Congress were churning out landmark domestic reforms left and right: [income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1913), the [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act), [women's suffrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), [Social Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Act), [minimum wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act), the [interstate highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aid_Highway_Act_of_1956) system, [Civil Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964), [Voting Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965), [Medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Amendments_of_1965), and so on.

In contrast, the past [five decades](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/polarized-politics-in-congress-began-in-the-1970s-and-has-been-getting-worse-ever-since/) have seen Congress polarized to the point of uselessness. The ACA is probably the "biggest" piece of legislation within my lifetime; it was passed along party lines, and doesn't hold a candle to the triumphs listed above.

What happened to the system that my parents and grandparents grew up with?

Television happened -- then cable, then the 24-hour news cycle, then content aggregators, then social media. Our data consumption has grown exponentially in the past half-century, and it's brought us way too close to the [sausage-making](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/16/AR2005041600154.html) process.

---

By today's standards, mid-century Americans had little access to their representatives. The internet didn't exist. Television channels [only went up to 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Channel_Receiver_Act). Long-distance phone calls were expensive. This gave parties and politicians a lot of freedom. Presidential candidates were [chosen by party insiders, not primary voters](http://www.museum.tv/eotv/presidential.htm). Senators could meet in smoke-filled rooms to find common ground -- and leverage [pork-barrel spending](http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/12/opinion/zelizer-the-case-for-earmarks/) to move things along. Poor supervision left the government susceptible to [corruption and nepotism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoils_system)... but it also gave elected officials elbow room to do their jobs.

Now, information access is fast. The internet lets us keep track of every word of every promise made on the campaign trail. Obsessive news networks allow us to not only judge our elected officials on the bills they pass, but also on how they do their jobs day-to-day. Today's representatives have little opportunity to negotiate behind closed doors -- attempts to do so are [lambasted by the press](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/04/ttip-tpp-trade-deals-secrecy-greenpeace-leak). The public wants to see everything right away; premature opinions take root; representatives are pressured to take uncompromising stances. In fact, politicians who appear too willing to compromise may find themselves [out of a job](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/jerry-brown-tea-party-threatens-primary-challenger).

We saw this in the 2010 Republican primaries, where [Tea Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_history_of_the_Tea_Party_movement) candidates displaced establishment Republicans in eight states. The Tea Party faction promised to take a hard line against President Obama's agenda -- regardless of what that agenda might be. We saw the same sentiment again in the 2016 primaries when Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz were runners-up in the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries. Both men are known for taking principled stands -- that is, [refusing to compromise](http://time.com/4250238/bernie-sanders-ted-cruz-partisan-senators/).

There's a trope of blaming bad outcomes on low-information voters, but recent decades have shown us that high-information voters cause problems as well, by micromanaging their representatives, and even pressuring them to act in bad faith. The desire to "win" at democracy leads to stunts like shutting down the government, refusing to consider executive appointments, and voting repeatedly to repeal the signature accomplishment of the sitting president. It's [possible, though unlikely](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/could-electoral-college-elect-clinton/), that we could even see a presidential election being decided by [faithless electors](https://www.change.org/p/electoral-college-electors-electoral-college-make-hillary-clinton-president-on-december-19).

In a sense, the representative nature of our democracy is breaking down, giving way to a direct democracy. The problem is, direct democracy doesn't work. Despite having strong opinions, the public doesn't have the time, interest, or expertise to run the country.

For example, consider a pair of [2016 San Francisco ballot measures](https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco_City_and_County,_California_ballot_measures), Prop J and Prop K. Prop J, which passed easily, proposed to set aside $150M per year for homelessness; Prop K, a sales tax to fund the measure, was soundly defeated. As the saying goes, "if you're explaining, you're losing." It's easy to rally support for simple, good-sounding policies. But when it comes to the nuts and bolts of making it work, it's a lot easier to poison a proposal than it is to convince a non-expert of its value.

Historically, American democracy has worked because information access
was slow. People would elect their representatives then -- by necessity
-- trust them to do their jobs. Those representatives would take the
time to read, write, and understand proposed legislation. They would
meet in smoke-filled rooms and find common ground across party lines.
That's how we got Social Security, Medicare, Voting Rights,
Glass-Steagal, and so on. The Interstate Highway Act, among the most
impactful pieces of legislation of the 20th century, was even passed by
a divided government.

<!-- TODO: What about pork? People sometimes argue it let politicians
compromise because they could bring money back to their district even when
voting for something they did not like. -->

Now, information access is fast. The internet lets us keep track of
every word of every promise made on the campaign trail. The 24-hour news
cycle allows us to not only judge our elected officials on the bills
they pass, but also on how they do their jobs day-to-day. Today's
representatives have little opportunity to find common ground behind
closed doors; in fact, those who appear too willing to compromise may
find themselves
[out of a job](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/jerry-brown-tea-party-threatens-primary-challenger).

<!--
Pork-barrel spending, once a powerful [tool for seeking compromise](http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/12/opinion/zelizer-the-case-for-earmarks/), remains near record lows since a 2011 moratorium[^2].

[^2]: [Pork-barrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_barrel) spending refers to softening a legislator's stance on a bill by offering something that's important to the voters they represent.

There's a trope of blaming bad outcomes on low-information voters --
voters who take politicians at their word, and trust them to act in good
faith -- and there's some truth to that. When voters don't keep tabs on
our elected officials, corruption goes unchecked. But we're seeing that
high-information voters cause problems as well, by micromanaging their
representatives, and even pressuring them to act in bad faith. The
desire to "win" at democracy leads to stunts like shutting down the
government, refusing to consider executive appointments, and voting
repeatedly to repeal the signature accomplishment of the sitting
president. It's
[possible, though unlikely](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/could-electoral-college-elect-clinton/),
that we could even see a presidential election being decided by
[faithless electors](https://www.change.org/p/electoral-college-electors-electoral-college-make-hillary-clinton-president-on-december-19).

In a sense, the representative nature of our democracy is breaking down,
giving way to a direct democracy. The problem is, direct democracy
doesn't work. Despite having strong opinions, the public doesn't have
the time, interest, or expertise to run the country.

For example, consider a pair of
[2016 San Francisco ballot measures](https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco_City_and_County,_California_ballot_measures),

making it work, it's a lot easier to poison a proposal than it is to

<!-- earmarks are another example? can we show public pressure to get rid of them? -->

Never has our democracy felt so direct -- that is, dysfunctional -- as
it did during Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Half of the
Democratic base complained that her proposed education spending was
[too ambitious](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/upshot/the-trouble-with-hillary-clintons-free-tuition-plan.html),
while the other half complained that it
[fell short](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/the-argument-that-the-bernie-or-bust-movement-is-b.html)
of what her opponent in the primaries had promised. She was dogged by
complaints that her racial justice positions
[weren't forceful enough](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/07/hillary-clinton-black-lives-matter-democratic-national-convention),
and also that she did too little to court
[blue-collar whites](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/hillary-clinton-michigan-loss),
who are wary of identity politics. In the end, too much of her base was
turned off by the idea of compromise, and she lost.

<!-- http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/bill-clintons-lonely-one-man-effort-to-win-white-working-class-voters/article/2607228 -->

Donald Trump, on the other hand, sidestepped this issue by refusing to
articulate his positions. He echoed iconic Republican talking points
when convenient -- low taxes, gun rights, law and order -- but became
evasive when pressed for details. His signature issue, a wall on the
Mexican border, is more bravado than policy. He won by leveraging his
personality: he held huge rallies, picked fights on Twitter, and
dominated the media coverage.

If we're surprised that the charismatic candidate beat the
policy-focused candidate, we shouldn't be; it happens every time.
Obama's campaigns were built on his powerful oratory skills. GWB ran as
the candidate you'd like to have a beer with. In the past four decades,
1988 is the only presidential election in which the winner (GHWB) could
reasonably be described as "smart but boring."

In fact, in the modern era, it's actually the Democrats who seem to be
most reliant in the charisma of their presidential candidates. JFK,
Carter, Bill Clinton, and Obama were famously charismatic, and inspired
high voter turnout. The same cannot be said of Mondale, Dukakis, Gore,
and Kerry. Perhaps this is because of the breadth of the Democratic
voter base -- a personality-focused campaign may help distract from the
disparate policy priorities of LGBT voters, young voters, and voters of
color[^2].

[^2]: One might naively imagine that people of color and LGBT people, both historically-marginalized groups, would easily find common ground. The reality is more complicated. For example, only [40% of Black Protestants approve of same-sex marriage](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/05/12/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/), compared to nearly 60% of the population overall.

Republican voter turnout, on the other hand, seems almost ambivalent to
the nominee. In 2004, GWB was a divisive incumbent with an unpopular war
hanging over him. In 2008, McCain was a cantankerous maverick with a
reputation for bipartisanship. In 2012, Romney was a moderate elite with
an unconventional faith. In 2016, Trump was a salacious TV star with no
experience in government. Each got almost the same number of votes.

After the Civil War, the federal government languished for half a century. There was [little common ground](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/01/16/our-politics-may-be-polarized-but-thats-nothing-new/) to be found between representatives from the northern states and those from the would-be Confederacy. Johnson, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, Cleveland, Harrison, McKinley... there were no legislative triumphs for these [forgotten presidents](http://www.aprilsmith.org/lesson-9-the-forgotten-presidents.html) to sign into law.

Congress found its feet just before the onset of WWI. It then went on a five-decade rampage, churning out landmark reforms left and right: [Income Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1913), the [Federal Reserve Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act), the [19th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), [Social Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Act), [FLSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act), [FLSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aid_Highway_Act_of_1956), [Civil Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964), [Voting Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965), [Medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Amendments_of_1965), and so on.

In recent decades, [we've seen polarization and gridlock return](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/polarized-politics-in-congress-began-in-the-1970s-and-has-been-getting-worse-ever-since/). No legislation of the past forty years holds a candle to the New Deal and Great Society. The [ACA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act) probably comes closest -- but unlike those mentioned above, it was passed along party lines.

What happened?

**In recent years, we've also seen unusual hostility toward [pork-barrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_barrel) spending, including a 2011 moratorium. Despite its unsavory reputation in this country, pork-barrel politics is an important [tool for seeking compromise](http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/12/opinion/zelizer-the-case-for-earmarks/); it can incentivize a legislator to soften their stance by offering something that's important to the voters they represent. For example, an Arizona senator agreed to break the filibuster of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in exchange for LBJ's approval of the Central Arizona Water Project.**

**According to an analysis by CAGW, earmarks bottomed out in 2011 and are still near record lows.**


How does negative campaigning fit into this?

People don't understand the government. This isn't to knock the public as ignorant -- the system is huge and archaic and complex.

Look at the makeup of the federal legislature versus the makeup of state legislatures. They track each other closely. This suggests that people vote per their partisan identity, not based on an understanding of what they're voting for.

Author: Craig Fehrman

http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-politics-is-national/

> That’s the good news for incumbents everywhere. Here’s the bad: if more than half of voters don’t know who runs the statehouse, then those same voters also don’t know whom to reward (or to blame). The best place to see this is in the research of Steven Rogers, a political scientist at St. Louis University who specializes in state legislatures. Rogers has analyzed decades of data across dozens of states. He’s tested various factors to see how they might influence voters: the state’s economy, tax rates, homicide rate and student reading scores, among others. What Rogers has found is that these measures have little or no effect on whether a state legislator wins re-election. Instead, state races correlate largely with presidential politics — whether the voter approves of the president and whether the legislator belongs to the president’s party. Crafting great (or terrible) legislation on jobs or criminal sentencing doesn’t seem to matter. "Whether or not state legislators are elected," Rogers said, "has very little to do with them."

For a sobering perspective on the public's knowledge of the political
process, we can look to a figure from FiveThirtyEight's Craig Fehrman:
