Infuse the peppers into the tequila a few weeks ahead of time. This won't make the drinks *spicy* exactly, but it'll leave a nice tingle on the tongue. If spice is what you're after, use habaneros instead.

Fire up your grill. When it's hot, grill each citrus half face-down until clear grill lines are visible, about 1 minute. Allow the citrus to cool, then juice them. Run the juice through a sieve to remove any seeds.

Mix the juice one-to-one with tequila. If it's too sour, add sugar or agave to taste -- and remember to buy fewer lemons next time!

Serve on the rocks. Makes about a dozen drinks.
