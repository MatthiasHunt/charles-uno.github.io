The first graph below shows the land areas and populations for a handful of countries laid out on a linear scale. That means there's equal spacing between Mongolia (3 million people), Panama (4 million), Norway (5 million), and so on. In general, a linear scale is a perfectly sensible way to arrange a graph, but in this case it's illegible. To make room for India (1.3 billion people) and China (1.4 billion), everything else gets squished together on the left margin. It's impossible to eyeball any sort of overall trend.

The second graph shows the exact same numbers on a logarithmic scale -- that is, they're spaced using multiplication instead of addition. Egypt has double the population of South Korea, which has double the population of Australia, which has double the population of Cuba. A log scale spaces those populations evenly so we can see how each factor of two plays into the overall trend.

Basically, log scales are useful when most of the numbers are small compared to the largest, but we don't want to clump all the small numbers together.











we want to show off trends

most of the numnbervalues are *much* smaller than the biggest ones.

significant differences between half the mass of the sun, twice the mass of the sun,

where the scale goes to 1000, but we also want to be able to see the differences between 1, 10, and 100

My background is in space physics, where log scales come up all the time.

Many stars are smaller than our sun, while a few are one hundred times as massive.






The vertical axis works the same way. Mexico has double the land of Egypt, which has double the land of Madagascar, which has double the land of New Zealand. A log scale spaces them out so we can see each difference.

The first graph below shows some demographic data for US states on a linear scale. That means there's equal spacing between Mississippi (3 million people), Oklahoma (4 million), South Carolina (5 million), and Maryland (6 million). That's a perfectly sensible way to set up a graph, but unfortunately, it's illegible. To make room for Texas (30 million) and California (40 million), the rest of the states get squished together on the left margin. It's difficult to eyeball any sort of overall trend.

The second graph shows the exact same numbers on a logarithmic scale. Essentially, that means they're laid out in terms of multiplication instead of addition. Florida has double the population of Ohio, which has double the population of Wisconsin, which has double the population of Kansas, which has double the population of Maine, which has double the population of Vermont. On a log scale, those are all spaced evenly so we can see the significance of each increment.

The spacing between Montana (1 million people) and New Mexico (2 million) is the same as the spacing between Michigan (10 million) and New York (20 million).

Log scaling lets us take into account the difference between Vermont (0.6 million people), Rhode Island (1 million), and Nebraska (1.9 million) even though they're all small compared to California.

China has quadruple the population of the USA, which has quadruple the population of Germany, which has quadruple the population of Sri Lanka, which has quadruple the population of New Zealand. Log scaling lets us look at all those differences at the same time.

Shanghai has double the population of Mumbai, which has double the population of Rio, which has double the population of Chicago, which has double the population of Philadelphia, which has double the population of Denver, which has double the population of Minneapolis

Difference between 1%, 5%, and 10% is very significant. 18/20 candidates are below 10% in the polling average, but they're all squished into the left third of the plot!

> And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the number of words spoken by each of the candidates roughly correlated with their polling averages over both nights, with the correlation being somewhat stronger during the second debate.

> But there were notable outliers, like Booker and Harris, who both spoke more than their polling averages might have predicted. Sanders and Warren were also outliers, in that they spoke less than their standing in the polls might have suggested. And then, of course, thereâ€™s Andrew Yang, who spoke the least out of all the candidates even though he was in the middle of the pack in polling average.


In their plot, it's not at all clear that Yang is in the "middle of the pack." But on a log scale, he's a clear outlier.
