## Banana Bread

- 250 mL (1 c) whole wheat flour
- 4 overripe bananas[^1]
- 150 mL (2/3 c) dark brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 75 mL (1/3 c, or 2/3 stick) softened butter
- 5 mL (1 t) baking soda
- 5 mL (1 t) salt
- 5 mL (1 t) vanilla extract
- 125 mL (1/2 c) mini dark chocolate chips[^2]

---

Preheat oven to 190C (375F).

Combine the bananas, brown sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking soda. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ones. The mixture should have about the consistency of yogurt; if it's too wet, add a bit more flour.

[^1]: Optionally, bananas can be swapped out for 400 mL (14 oz) cooked/canned sweet potato, pumpkin, butternut squash, or similar.

Add the chocolate chips, then spoon the batter into a buttered loaf pan[^3]. Bake until a toothpick in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Allow the loaf to cool, then carefully remove it from the pan. Banana bread can be stored at room temperature for a few days; keep a towel over it to prevent it from going stale.

*The ends of the loaf make for unsightly french toast, so you should probably just eat them.*

Turn off the oven, put a towel over the loaf, and let it sit overnight. You should probably eat a little bit of it, just to make sure it's turned out alright.

[^2]: Chopped nuts and dried cranberries can be used instead of (or in addition to) chocolate chips.

[^3]: Bake time is closer to 25 minutes for muffins, or 15 minutes for mini muffins. Muffins aren't much use for making french toast, but they're great for snacking and sharing.

## French Toast

- 3 eggs
- 75 mL (1/3 c) plain yogurt
- cinnamon to taste

---

In the morning, start some butter in a large skillet over medium heat.

Combine the remaining 3 eggs, yogurt, and cinnamon. Slice the loaf (or whatever's left of it) and dip the slices in the egg mixture, making sure to coat both sides. Fry until golden brown on both sides.

*One slice is typical. Two slices is ambitious. Three slices is madness.*

Serves four. Best with fruit, jam, and/or peanut butter.
