TODO: square images? Maybe we still want to stretch anything that's explicitly 16x9, like the Scryfall wallpapers. Or maybe we want to go through and update? Mobile doesn't like wide images, and it'd be nice to be able to piggyback off IG.

Also, if our photos start respecting text width, everything is going to get super narrow. Maybe look at a different layout for wider screens? Like Alex has: top bar for narrow screens, sidebar for wide
