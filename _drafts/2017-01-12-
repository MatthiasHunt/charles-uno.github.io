Last year my group moved our campaign away from Pathfinder. There were two main reasons. The first was complexity (which I've <a href="http://cookingwithcharles.blogspot.com/2013/11/building-tuktuk.html">written about</a> already). The second reason was power. The GM had (I think reasonable) concerns about the power levels of high-level Pathfinder characters. He really wasn't interested in running a game where a player can easily turn into an <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/form-of-the-dragon-i">elephant-sized dragon</a> or <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/meteor-swarm">firebomb an entire battlefield</a>. <br><br>

We investigated dozens of rules systems, and playtested a handful of them. In the end we settled on Fate Core. The simple action resolution clicked for us, even if <a href="http://fate-srd.com/fate-core/aspects-fate-points">aspects</a> took a bit of getting used to. From here we started reading about the different magic systems that people use in Fate Core. There are some <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-sneak-peak-magic-system-toolkit/">official ones</a> plus plenty of homebrewed creations. <BR><BR>

We quickly decided that <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic">Vancian magic</a> and spell quotas were not important parts of our storytelling. In fact, every magic system we looked at seemed too crunchy for our taste. We finally came to the realization that we didn't need <i>any</i> extra rules to run magic in Fate Core. The game already has a magic system, written implicitly into the <a href="http://fate-srd.com/fate-core/default-skill-list">skill system</a>. <br><BR>

Time for a few mental gymnastics. What if, instead of thinking of skills as an abstraction of what a character is good at, we think of them as what a character is good at <i>accomplishing</i>? Athletics can be rolled to run, jump, swim, climb, or cartwheel. It can move you any way you like. So why not let a player roll Athletics to teleport or fly? Shoot does damage at a distance using guns, arrows, rocks, or shuriken, so why not a fireball? Rapport can be used to create the advantage <i>I Like These Guys</i>, so why not <i>Charmed</i>? Crafts can be rolled to create an <i>Improvised Barricade</i>, so why not a <i>Wall of Fire</i>? <br><BR>

What really makes this magic system work is aspects, Fate's trademark mechanic. The whole point of aspects is to sidestep rules-crunchiness by letting players explain things in their own words; those explanations then dictate the sorts of in-world actions that make sense. For example, let's look at my dwarven barbarian (<i>Don't Hit First; Hit Last</i>) and Jan's half-orc sorcerer (<i>Mamma Dragon</i>):<br>


<center><table width=90% cellpadding=5><tbody>
<tr style="background-color:#dddddd"><td width=30%></td><td width=30%><center><b>Tor Byorn Yorgensen</b></center></td><td width=30%><center><b>Nock</b></center></td></tr>
<tr><td><center><b>A Fight is Brewing</b></center></td><td>Rolls Physique to create the advantage <i>Girded Loins</i></td><td>Rolls Physique to create the advantage <i>Dragonskin</i></td></tr>
<tr style="background-color:#dddddd"><td><center><b>Water Elementals Attack the Ship</b></center></td><td>Jump into the water and roll Athletics to swim like a <i>Tor-pedo</i></td><td>Take to the skies: roll Athletics for the advantage <i>Flying</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><center><b>Weapon of Choice</b></center></td><td>His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7bdr6fjg-k">hammer</a>, rolled with Fight</td><td>Fireballs, rolled with Shoot</td></tr>
</tbody></table></center><br>


Note that this magic system is great for compels. In my mind at least, this is a big selling point. Compels are probably the trickiest part of Fate. Many groups have trouble getting the hang of them. But at the same time, they're absolutely crucial: compels are Fate's way of making sure that the mechanics of Fate serve the narrative, not vice versa. <BR><BR>

For example, suppose Nock ends up in an anti-magic field, preventing him from shooting fireballs. In desperation, he picks up a crossbow. He still has an excellent Shoot score, so you might expect him to be just as effective with the crossbow as he was with fireballs... <I>except that would make no sense in the story!</i> <BR><BR>

This situation is solved by having the GM throw Nock's player a fate point: "You've never even held a crossbow before. Your first shot isn't even close, and you can't figure out how to reload it." The table feels good because now the anti-magic field has introduced some real tension: their sorcerer has been neutered. Nock's player also feels good, having just been paid a fate point to play along. <BR><BR>

Some of Fate's biggest strengths are flexibility, simplicity, and balance; our magic system piggybacks on each one. Players have a lot of freedom to define their characters' magical abilities through their character aspects and skill choices. The rules for casting spells are simple, even if the desired outcome seems complicated. And the power level of magic users never gets out of hand -- the size of an effect is limited by the number of fate points fed into it. (Plus, in this system wizards have to balance their skills just like everyone else... they can't power their entire toolbox by maximizing Intelligence.) <BR><BR>

of course, from the opposite angle, those strengths might seem like weaknesses. Putting all the creative power in the hands of the players means that it's <i>not</i> in the hands of the game designers. This system doesn't come with rules about what can or cannot be done with magic, how to prepare spells, or how many level four spells a wizard can cast per day. This can be particularly upsetting to new players -- coming up with spells on the fly is a lot harder than picking them from a list! <BR><BR>

The hacklable nature of Fate makes it hard to argue that there is a "best" magic system. Different things resonate with different groups. However, it does bear noting that this system adds the least-possible amount of complexity to the rules: none. <br><br>
