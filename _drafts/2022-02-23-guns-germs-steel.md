At the Massacre of Cajamarca, Pizarro and a few hundred Spaniards killed thousands of Incas and captured Emperor Atahualpa without suffering a single casualty.
Then they marched on the capital city of Cusco, killing thousands more Incan warriors along the way.
The Incan empire --- which at the time was [more populous than Spain][1500_populations] --- fell shortly thereafter.

[1500_populations]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_1500

The Spanish invasion was so successful, in part, because the conquistadors wore steel armor and rode horses.
They also carried (and were resistant to) deadly diseases such as smallpox.
Written language allowed Pizarro to model his tactics after the victories of Cort√©s.
And of course, Europe had the political structures to send expeditions around the world in the first place.
In his 1997 bestseller *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, Jared Diamond digs into human history (and prehistory) in order to explain why all these technologies[^1] developed in Eurasia[^2] but fewer or none of them developed on other continents.

[^1]: For lack of a better word, "technology" is used broadly here. It includes agriculture, livestock domestication, politics, written language, resistance to diseases, and more.

[^2]: The author uses "Eurasia" to refer jointly to Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The mediterranean coast of Africa is sometimes included as well. These regions have been linked by migration and trade for thousands of years.

Right off the bat, the author addresses the elephant in the room: it's not about race.
He emphatically rejects the idea that people in Eurasia were innately superior to those in Australia, the Americas, or Sub-Saharan Africa.
Instead, Diamond writes from the perspective of a biologist studying the human species overall.
The emphasis is not on individual people, or even groups, so much as the environments faced by early humans in different regions.

At the end of the last ice age (about 13,000 years ago) humans worldwide lived in nomadic hunter-gatherer societies.
Populations grew as the climate warmed.
Around that same time, mammoths and many other large animals [went extinct][extinction].
With more mouths to feed, and less game to hunt, humans became increasingly dependent on plants for food.
Cereals and legumes were particularly important.
Over thousands of years, humans in the Fertile Crescent domesticated wheat, barley, and peas.
Rice and soybeans were domesticated in China[^3] around that same time.

[^3]: The author devotes a lot of pages to the emergence of food production in the Fertile Crescent, including analysis of the climate and geography. Similar analysis is lacking for China, even though crops were domesticated there around the same time. It's possible that archeological evidence from China was more difficult to access in the 1990s. This is my biggest frustration with the book.

<span class="figure-caption">Wheat, barley, and peas were first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent about 10,000 years ago.</span>

The shift from hunter-gatherer society to sedentary food production was accidental, slow, and hungry.
But once it was established, it snowballed.
Food production allowed rapid population growth and large population density.
Surplus food (and food storage) also freed up resources for specialized roles.
Food producers were the first human societies to have full-time artisans and bookkeepers --- as well as soldiers.
Neighboring hunter-gatherer societies were assimilated or displaced.
By about 8,000 years ago, Eurasia was covered with sedentary population centers built around food production.








Food production laid the groundwork for all the technologies mentioned up top.
Tracking and allocating bulk quantifies of food gave rise to writing and politics.
War between armies demanded new weapons and armor.
Close proximity to livestock (important for fertilizer and plowing tough soil) is a vector for new diseases.

Diamond spends the second half of his book fleshing out each of these causal chains.
Honestly, I skimmed some of it.

I think the context is important
Good place to pause and give him credit






So now the big question becomes: why did food production arise in Eurasia 10,000 years ago, much later in the Americas and Sub-Saharan Africa, and not at all in Australia?

The author spends about 100 pages on this topic.




animal domestication. diseases here too.

east-west continent. sahara, mexican desert

Agriculture developed elsewhere much later (Africa, America) or not at all (Australia).
this is 75 pages


Staple foods domesticated elsewhere, such as sorghum in Africa and corn in the Americas, did not appear until much more recently.
No grains or beans in Australia.

- Archeological evidence suggests that humans were familiar with native plant species.
- Recent efforts have domesticated many new fruits and vegetables, but no new staple foods.
- Corn was hard to domesticate. Millet far less productive.
- One crop isn't enough. Apples are native to the Americas, but you can't live on just apples.
- Transition from hunter-gatherer to food production is really hard!
- Animals. Only Eurasia has anything big enough to pull a plow. You can tame an elephant but it's still a dangerous wild animal.

Climate becomes more friendly to wild cereals, especially in mediterranean areas.

fertile crescent is the largest and most varied mediterranean biome on the planet. no surprise that the most (and best) grasses would evolve there.



linguistics? used to show the spread of populations

linguistics. did farming spread or did farme*rs* spread. also skeletal structure

similar climates: south africa, mediterranean, california, sw australia

first farmers worked harder, were smaller, died younger than hunter gatherers

shifting from mostly wild food to mostly cultivated took thousands of years

8500bc vs 18500bs. wild game less abundant. wild cereals more abundant due to climate. technology for storage. density high enough to value calories per acre. p112

some areas suitable for food production but HGs never displaced due to geography. CA separated by desert from AZ. south africa with a different climate from tropical bantu crops. australia separated by sea from NG, indonesia. p113

wild almonds are bitter and toxic, but it's just one gene. early humans would find non-bitter ones by accident, interact preferrentially, propagate by accident then intentionally. p118

barley, wheat, peas, lentils, flax, poppies. natural seed dispersal threw seeds on the ground. single gene caused that to fail, making them much easier to harvest. accidental domestication since those are the ones that got propagated. p120

some species we failed to domesticate until recently. acorns, strawberries. p129

All staple foods were domesticated thousands of years ago. Some recent fruits and veggies but no grains or beans to build a civilization on. p133

agriculture is great. but the transition from hunter-gatherer society to sedentary farming is hard. wheat is really high in calories and protein so there's more room for error. grasses native to other parts of the world are less good.

Early conflicts with Europeans were similarly lopsided in Australia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Compared to hunting and gathering, farming allows more people to live on the same amount of land. Some of those people can even take on non-farming roles.

Dedicated warriors secure resources.
Dedicated bureaucrats allocate them.

politicians need written language to handle resource allocation in a big society

Warriors force neighboring societies to assimilate or be displaced.

A farmer can grow enough wheat to feed their family, plus a surplus to feed others, all with less land than a band of hunter-gatherers would require to survive.

Higher population density becomes possible, as do specialized roles such as leader and warrior.

Those neighbors can then take on other specialized roles like artisan, leader, or warrior.

Higher population density becomes feasible, as do specialized roles like artisan and warrior.

Farming allows a society higher population density than hunting and gathering.

It also frees up resources to

As a result,
Farming societies can support higher population density than hunter-gatherer societies.
Centralized food production also makes other specialized roles possible, such as artisans, leaders, and warriors.

This makes higher population density possible, and also frees up resources for other members of that society to take on specialized roles like leader or
In a hunter-gatherer society, everyone's job is a matter of survival: finding food, securing shelter, raising children, and so on.

It becomes possible to support full-time artisans, leaders, and warriors.

Wheat is native to the Middle East.
It was domesticated first by accident, then intentionally as hunter-gatherer societies gradually became sedentary.

Hunter-gatherer societies gradually became sedentary.

Corn is native to the Americas.
Africa has teff and millet.
Europe and Asia were fortunate enough to have wheat.



Modern researchers have attempted domestication of other native grasses

our ultimate cause would have to explain why similar philosophies did not become dominant elsewhere!






It's not Christianity or democracy, which are thousands of years too late to explain







Diamond pulls together an impressive breadth of


Diamond's ultimate cause is so elegant that it's almost disappointing.

In a word, the answer is wheat.
Early humans in the americas domesticated corn.
In africa, millet and teff
