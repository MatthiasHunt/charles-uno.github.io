In a large, deep pan, start the bacon low and slow, rendering out as much fat as possible. When the bacon is just about done, stir in the onion. Season generously with black pepper and rosemary. Cook, stirring intermittently, until the onions reduce by half.

*The vegetables will cook way down, and the wild rice and lentils will cook way up!*

Pour in the broth and water[^1], then add the rice, lentils, carrots, and celery. Bring to a boil. Boil uncovered, stirring once in a while, until the rice and lentils are cooked and the carrots are soft. This should take about an hour. 

[^1]: The broth-to-water ratio can be adjusted to taste. More broth means more flavor, but too much can make the wild rice stubborn about cooking through. This may have to do with acidity.

Shortly before serving, stir in the kale. Within a few minutes, it should soften and its color should brighten notably.

*The resulting stew is quite thick, since the lentils and wild rice soak up most of the broth as they cook.*

This stew is great for leftovers -- it's dense and it reheats well. It's even pretty healthy!
