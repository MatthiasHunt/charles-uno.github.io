The day after Trump was sworn in as president, [Women's March](https://www.womensmarch.com/) protests drew an estimated 3.2M people -- [ten times as many](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-long-march-ahead-for-democrats/) as the Tea Party protests that followed Obama's inauguration in 2009. I attended the march at the Minnesota Capitol, which drew about 100k people, and came away conflicted.

---

By and large, I was impressed by the speakers. Rep Betty McCollum, Lt Gov Tina Smith, and Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges drummed up support for healthcare access, racial justice, and LGBT rights. State Rep Ilhan Omar (noted for being the nation's first Somali-American legislator) leveraged her personal story into a powerful, forward-looking pledge to improve female representation in government. Several speakers echoed Hillary's iconic line from Beijing, "women's rights are human rights," to massive applause.

References to Trump were infrequent. And while he was always the opponent, speeches avoided sensationalist labels like "enemy," "evil," "fascist," and "Nazi."

In contrast, the crowd's signs struck a reactionary tone: jabs at Trump's hands and hair, images of Trump with a Hitler-style mustache, and "this pussy grabs back." For every sign about unity or progress, there was another fixated on opposition to the president. I was particularly struck by "Not My President" -- the same slogan [used by the Tea Party](http://www.cafepress.com/rightwingstuff/6166025) against Obama.

I'm concerned that the Democratic Party is about to be faced with an insurgency of hard-liners -- much like the one that hollowed out the Republican establishment and paved the way for Trump in the first place.

At the march/rally, I was impressed with the speakers, but frustrated with many of the signs. I don't want to be part of a Tea Party movement on the left, fixated on opposition to the President. I'm concerned that we'll see a rise of insurgent hard-liners in Democratic primaries.

Ideological purity tests are how you build a small tent full of extremists -- who obstruct when they're in the minority and steamroll when they're in the majority.

I'd much rather have a big tent centered around broad, forward-looking goals: healthcare access, racial justice, livable wages, etc. If that means supporting pro-gun progressives in SD, or pro-pharma progressives in NJ, so be it. I don't need to agree with everyone about everything.

The strength of a coalition comes from its size, not its homogeneity.

[Sanders suggested that Clinton was not a real progressive.](http://time.com/4205149/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-progressive/)

[Rep Barney Frank wrote in 1991:](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vqJJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Xg0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=4293,3641940&hl=en)

> His holier-than-thou attitude -- saying in a very loud voice that he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else -- really undercuts his effectiveness.

> To him, anyone who disagrees with him is a crook; there are no honest disagreements with people. Bernie's view of the world is that the great majority of people agree with him on all the issues and the only reason he does not win is that the Congress is crooked.

If the Women's March was a rally for the Democratic Party, organizers were wrong to kick pro-life groups to the curb. Pro-life Democrats exist, and they deserve a spot under the tent. (If the DNC only supported across-the-board progressives, it would be unable to compete for Senate seats in conservative states.)

On the other hand, if the Women's March was about rallying support for reproductive rights, including the right to abortion, the prominent inclusion of pro-life groups would muddle the message. Recall Occupy Wall Street: protests can't be powerful unless they're coherent.

The official website frames the march in terms of issues, not partisanship, and lists "open access to safe, legal, affordable abortion and birth control" as a core principle.

But that framing should perhaps be taken with a grain of salt -- the event's headliners were Democratic officials, 80% of its participation was in Obama/Clinton states, and









Sen Booker says "This is not a Democrat or Republican thing. This is actually something we can all unify around."

If opposition to Trump is (or appears) partisan, Trump wins in Congress. Rep Lewis's all-Democrat inauguration boycott presents the appearance of a unified GOP.

To erode Trump's 46%, it's important to showcase dissent within the GOP.

The march in DC [outnumbered](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/22/us/politics/womens-march-trump-crowd-estimates.html) the inauguration crowds the day before[^1].

[^1]: Comparing crowds in DC isn't quite fair, as Trump faces a home field disadvantage; he earned [only 4%](http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/district-of-columbia) of the vote there.
