Based on an analysis of all legal words in Wordle, the [best starting word][soare] is `SOARE`.
Or maybe, using [information theory][crane], it's `CRANE`.
An [economist recommends][slice] `SLICE` if you want to minimize number of moves, or `ADEPT` if you want to minimize your odds to fail.
I personally start with `RATIO`, since I get the feeling that the author avoids[^1] the letter `E` to keep things interesting.
All these big-brain takes raise the question: how much does it really matter?

[^1]: The letter `E` appears in far more possible solutions than any other letter. However, four other letters (`I`, `N`, `O`, and `R`) appeared in more Wordles in January 2022. On top of that, there was only a single puzzle (`PERKY`) where `E` was the only vowel, while each other vowel appeared on its own repeatedly (for example, `U` was the only vowel in `WRUNG`, `SLUMP`, and `TRUSS`).

To investigate, I put together a computer simulation of Wordle (source code [here][source]).
The first guess can be specified.
Each subsequent guess is chosen randomly, taking into account all past clues.
Essentially, the computer plays in hard mode[^2] and always goes with the first compatible guess that pops into its head.
By applying that strategy to thousands upon thousands of puzzles, we can get a sense for the importance of a good opening word.

[^2]: From an informal survey, it seems like most people follow the rules of hard mode, whether or not they've flipped the toggle.

*My code can generate and solve about a thousand random Wordle puzzles per minute.*

Before we get into the results, a quick disclaimer.
Wordle has two word lists.
There's a list of possible solutions (2,300 words) and a list of allowed guesses (12,900 words).
The vast majority of "real" words are in the solutions list, while the [non-solution words][non_solutions] are mostly nonsense like `KYLIX` and `UMIAQ`.
In the interest of imitating human play patterns, the model completely ignores the non-solution word list.

I ran each of the starting words from above through 40,000 simulated puzzles.
Then I did the same with a variety of other starting words for comparison: `ADIEU` (lots of vowels), `JERKY` (lots of consonants), `GEESE` (duplicate vowels), `FLUFF` (duplicate consonants), `MOIST` (funny), and `XYLYL` (possibly the [worst starting word][soare]).
Results are shown in the table below:

| First Guess | Win Rate (±0.5%) | Average Guesses (±0.02) |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-----------------------:|
| `ADEPT`     |         98.8%    |            3.92         |
| `ADIEU`     |         97.4%    |            4.02         |
| `CRANE`     |         98.5%    |            3.82         |
| `FLUFF`     |         97.4%    |            4.39         |
| `GEESE`     |         97.6%    |            4.21         |
| `JERKY`     |         96.9%    |            4.25         |
| `MOIST`     |         98.7%    |            3.92         |
| `RATIO`     |         98.0%    |            3.91         |
| `SLICE`     |         98.8%    |            3.84         |
| `SOARE`     |         97.9%    |            3.88         |
| `XYLYL`     |         95.7%    |            4.50         |

<p class='table-caption'>The first column shows the starting word. The second shows the success rate for solving a puzzle with that starting word. The third shows the average number of guesses required for successful solutions.</p>

Regardless of your starting word, you will generally be able to solve the daily Wordle.
Even `XYLYL`, which includes duplicate letters and no vowels, leads to solutions more than 95% of the time.
That's about 349 wins and 16 losses over the course of a year.
Pretty much any "real" word wins at least 97% of puzzles (less than 11 losses per year), and even the most efficient words fall short of 99% (more than 4 losses per year).
With such small numbers[^4], you'd be hard pressed to notice a difference week-over-week, or even month-over-month.

*Wordle-style graphs for a handful of starting words. No surprises here. The best starting words also have the best odds of winning faster.*

[^4]: Statistics is tricky for small numbers. Over the course of 365 samples, a 2% failure rate will show up about 5-11 times. A 3% failure rate will show up about 7-13 times. There's a lot of overlap there!






| `CRYPT`     |         98.9%    |            3.98         |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-----------------------:|
| `GLYPH`     |         98.7%    |            4.09         |
| `LYMPH`     |         98.8%    |            4.10         |









The numbers above suggest that `CRANE` and `SLICE` are tied as the best words for starting a Wordle puzzle.
The difference between them is very small -- well within the bounds of statistical uncertainty.
On average `CRANE` and `SLICE` lead to wins in fewer guesses than any of the other words listed above.
They also produce excellent win rates.
A win rate of 98.5% corresponds to about 360 wins and 5 losses per year.
Several other words have similar win rates, but none are better to a statistically significant degree.

In comparison, starting your daily Wordle puzzle with `XYLYL` for a year would lead to about 349 wins and 16 failures.
You'll still win most puzzles, but that's triple the failure rate compared to `CRANE` or `SLICE`.
Winning will also require more guesses, since you're not getting much information from `XYLYL`.





Most words are closer to 98% win rate.







Most "real" words (five different letters, including common ones)








The win rate for `XYLYL`, 95.7%, is still a pretty big number.
But over the course of a year, that's about 15 failures, or triple the failure rate compared to `CRANE` or `SLICE`.




It's hard to lose at hard mode.
Even a terrible guess still gives you clues to narrow down future guesses.

If your first few guesses are way off, you'll have eliminated a lot of letters.


Regardless of your starting word, you can almost always win on hard mode.




3.83 per day
27 guesses per week
115 per month
1398 per year


4.50 per day
31.5 per week
135 per month



If you want to win Wordle in the fewest guesses, my data suggests you should start with `CRANE` or `SLICE`.




My data shows that `CRANE` and `SLICE` are the best starting words, both in terms of speed and consistency.
The difference between them is not statistically significant.




The difference between them is not statistically significant.















If you start your daily puzzle with `CRANE` or `SLICE`, you should expect to whiff on only





Unsurprisingly, `XYLYL` is a terrible starting word.
`ADIEU` is about on par with random. Maybe worse. Turns out consonants matter. The solution probably has two vowels, so checking all four often gives redundant information.
`CRANE` and `SLICE` are the best in terms of converging fast. No statistically significant difference between them
`SOARE`, `RATIO`, `ADEPT` are all better than random, but visibly worse than the top two

put into perspective of... a month? a year? how many failures, how many extra guesses






Values are plus-or-minus about half a percent. That means the difference between 98.1% and 98.6% is not statistically significant.





This may skew my numbers one way or another overall[^3], but I see no reason it should affect relative comparisons between starting words.

[^3]: Using an optimal strategy, [The Economic Times][slice] says `SLICE` and `CRANE` should lead to a solution in 3.90 and 3.92 guesses respectively. My numbers are close to that, but my strategy is not optimal.




<!--
Based on our analysis, if you're trying to win in as few guesses as possible, the top three words to go with are "slice," "tried" and "crane." Using any of these three words will produce an average number of word attempts of 3.90, 3.92, and 3.92, respectively, if you're using an optimal strategy to play (more on that later).

If, on the other hand, you're simply trying to win within the allotted six guesses, the top three words to play are "adept," "clamp" and "plaid." Using any of these three words will yield an average success rate in winning the game of 98.79%, 98.75%, and 98.75%, respectively, if you're playing the optimal strategy.
