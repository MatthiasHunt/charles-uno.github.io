# Arboreal Grazer vs Sakura-Tribe Scout

Scout:
- Activate at instant speed
- Ramps repeatedly

Grazer:
- Can block
- Helps T2 Azusa
- Can Pact for it later like Elvish Spirit Guide





# Explore vs Growth Spiral

Like Scout, Growth Spiral offers instant-speed land drops. The only downside is the mana cost. It turns out that's a *big* downside. In terms of goldfishing, Growth Spiral is about half as effective as Explore.
