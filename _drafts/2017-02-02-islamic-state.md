In light of the Paris attacks, the majority of Americans oppose accepting Syrian refugees (despite the fact that the attackers were European nationals). This isn't the opinion of someone who cares to understand the difference between "Islam" and "Islamism" -- it's the opinion of someone who can't find Syria on a map.

When we insist on talking about ISIS in terms of Islam, we blur the line between ISIS and the world's other 1.6B Muslims. We make it hard for the Muslim world to reject Wahhabism as un-Islamic. We strengthen ISIS's ability to recruit disaffected Muslims. And we endanger our neighbors by reinforcing anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, and anti-refugee sentiments.

We shouldn't be choosing our rhetoric to best convey the nuance of ISIS's ideology. We should be choosing it to disentangle the words "Muslim" and "terrorist" in the hearts and minds of millions.

Iraq has Muslim terrorists. Uganda has Christian terrorists. Myanmar has Buddhist terrorists.

ISIS's narrative is that the West is at war with Islam. As much as anything else, this is a PR campaign to recruit disaffected Muslims to their cause. The West, particularly in the wake of the Paris bombings, has been all too eager to play into that narrative.

When we refer to ISIS in terms of Islam, we muddle the line between ISIS and the other 1.6B Muslims on the planet. We're not inviting the world's Muslims to be our allies; we're accusing them of being our enemies. We're endangering our neighbors by feeding anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, and anti-refugee sentiments.

When Ben says "Islam must be the answer to ISIS," he's half right. It's true that the campaign against ISIS must be led by regional powers. But this is not a commentary on Islam; it's a commentary on the West. We've spent a century controlling Iraq's oil supply through military coercion. It's no surprise that Iraqis don't trust us.

Analogies abound. In Uganda, Christian terrorists conscript and enslave children. In Myanmar, Buddhist terrorists displaced 100k people in 2012. It would be inappropriate for the West to take unilateral action against LRA or 969. But when faced with these tragedies, should our first response be to remind Christians and Buddhists everywhere that this is their problem?

Or can we recognize that terrorism is a product of regional unrest... of colonialism... of the same past that's given us wealth and safety?

Your first commenter wants to shoot Muslim babies. Your second commenter wants to kick all 50 million Muslims out of Europe. They don't know anything about Wahhabism, even though they're commenting on an article about it.

People like them are the reason the left won't say "Islamic terrorism." The phrase suggests we are at war with Islam. It feeds racism and xenophobia towards our Muslim and Arab neighbors. It also endorses increased military action in the middle east, which is what got us into this mess in the first place.
