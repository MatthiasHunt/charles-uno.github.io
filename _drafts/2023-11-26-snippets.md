## New Housing Construction Lowers Rent Nearby

Researchers generally agree that new market-rate housing (sometimes branded as "luxury") drives down rent nearby. See:

- [Asquith et al (2023)][asquith_et_al_2023]: "new buildings decrease rents in nearby units"
- [Been et al (2023)][been_et_al_2023]: "increases in housing supply slow the growth in rents in the region" and furthermore "it has not been shown to cause significant displacement"
- [Been et al (2018)][been_et_al_2018]: "adding new homes moderates price increases and therefore makes housing more affordable to low- and moderate-income families"
- [Li (2021)][li_2021]: "for every ... increase in the housing stock, rents decrease"
- [Mast (2019)][mast_2019]: "new construction reduces demand and loosens the housing market in low and middle-income areas, even in the short run"
- [Mense (2020)][mense_2020]: "increasing the flow of new supply ... lowers average rents"
- [Pennington (2021)][pennington_2021]: "rents and displacement fall differentially near new market rate projects"

I did also find one piece of dissenting literature:

- [Damiano and Frenier (2020)][damiano_and_frenier_2020]: "lower-priced rental housing close to new construction had ... higher rents"

## Pregnancy is About as Dangerous as Kidney Donation

The mortality rate for carrying a pregnancy to term (including delivery) is about [1 in 5k][pregnancy_mortality]. 
In the short term, pregnancy has a significant impact on quality of life: nausea, weight gain, reduced mobility, [dietary restrictions][pregnancy_diet], [joint loosening][joint_loosening], etc.
Pregnancy also increases the long-term risk for [chronic pain][c_section_chronic_pain] and [cardiovascular disease][pregnancy_long_term_effects].

The mortality rate for kidney donors is about 1 in 5k, though [estimates][kidney_mortality_1] [vary][kidney_mortality_2]. 
Recovery lasts [a month or two][donor_recovery], during which time donors are advised to avoid strenuous activity. 
Long-term side effects can include [high blood pressure and chronic pain][kidney_donor_long_term_risks]
Life expectancy is [not adversely affected][kidney_life_expectancy].

Organ donation in the USA is [strictly voluntary][donation_requires_consent].
The government cannot force you to donate a kidney under any circumstances --- even if you are the only possible donor, even to save the life of your child, and even if you had [previously agreed][donor_can_change_mind] to donate.

## Free Contraception Reduces Abortion

Colorade offered free contraception (pill and IUD) from 2009-2016. The abortion rate fell by about half ([source][co_free_contraception_1], [source][co_free_contraception_2]).

## Self Defense Gun Use

Harvard School of Public Health [summarizes a number of papers][hsph_guns]. Key results include:

- Guns are rarely used in self-defense. They are more often used to escalate arguments and intimidate family members. 
- A gun in the home does not reduce the risk of home invasion, and does not reduce the risk of injury during a home invasion. But it does increase the risk of death by accident, homicide, or suicide.

## Israel and Palestine

Very abridged history:

- Late 1800s: In response to antisemitism in Europe, Jews start buying land in Palestine.
- 1917: UK declares support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. First major power to do so. 
- 1939-1945: World War 2. Nazis commit genocide against Jews in Europe.
- 1947: UN recommends a two-state solution for Jews and Arabs. Arab states decline. Israel declares independence. Arab states attack. Israel wins. 
- 1967: 
- settlements. golan heights?

- Hamas came to power in 2006 (?). There has been no election since. 
- Hamas is a militant terrorist group. They intentionally target civilians, including children. They use refugee camps as human shields. Their actions are indefensible.
- Israel has the vast majority of the power. They can shut off running water and electricity to Gaza. They can bulldoze it. They control Gaza's borders, airspace, and access to the sea.
- Israeli GDP, Gaza GDP. Maybe unemployment rate too.
- Palestinians have been offered a two-state solution in the past, but with significant asterisks. For example, Israel would have retained control of Palestinian airspace and borders. Land but no sovereignty.
- Israel is tightly coupled to American intelligence and military technology. It's 
- Arab citizens of Israel (about 20% of the population) can vote. But Palestinians living in Gaza, etc, are not citizens.


First, a quick summary of [the world's most intractable conflict](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3965270):

Antisemitism in Europe induced large-scale Jewish immigration to the Middle East beginning in the 1800s. A Jewish state was proposed by Britain during WWI, then accepted by the UN following WWII. Arab states refused to recognize Israel. 
After some wars, Israel was left occupying the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank, both inhabited by Arabs.
Relations have since normalized between Israel and [several Arab states][arab_states_recognize_israel]

Maybe Biden is [playing the long game][netanyahu_long_game], laying the groundwork for a lasting peace after Hamas and Likud are [out of power][dems_israel_elections].

Conspiracy theories. 

Easy to see Netanyahu align with Putin, as another right-wing leader happy to encroach on its neighbors. This would be very bad for the USA. Israel has been deeply entangled in US intelligence operations since 9-11. Israel also has NATO-level access to US military technology. 
Vetoed some stern letters from the UN, usually because he wants to see more blame pointed at Hamas.

"From the river to the sea" is literally calling for the destruction of Israel!

TODO: Estimate of rates before roe v wade

Catholic church tolerates abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy. Fetus grows in the fallopian tube instead of the womb. Dangerous for both -- but there are recorded cases of both surviving birth. Scholarly tradition. They have to admit that biology is complicated.
