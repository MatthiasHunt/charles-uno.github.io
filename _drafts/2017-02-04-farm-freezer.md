If you live in a metropolitan area, you're probably not far from a local farmers market. These markets are a great, budget-friendly way to get some extra vegetables into your diet, as well as to support your local farmers. Unlike grocery stores, which ship in produce from Mexico, California, and other regions with year-round growing seasons, local farmers markets (typically) source locally. As a result, different kinds of produce are available at different times of year; asparagus grows in the spring, apples in the fall, etc.

Seasonal swings in selection can be inconvenient week-to-week, but if you're willing to put in a little bit of time, these swings can also be an opportunity. As the season winds down, farmers are looking to unload surplus tomatoes, peppers, etc. They sell them by the bucket -- five, ten, or even twenty pounds at a time. That's way more than you could reasonably eat before it spoiled, but by freezing those veggies, you can have access to them all winter!

*In Minnesota, the farmers market is the only place to find red (ripe) jalapeño peppers. They're much more flavorful than the green ones. In the dead of winter, they're perfect for chili or jalapeño-infused tequila.*

The eventual goal is to be able to reach into the freezer, grab a handful of whatever you need, and toss it right into your stir-fry, soup, or smoothie. There are two important steps to making that happen.

First, fruits and vegetables should be rinsed and prepared before freezing. Stumps, skins, and seeds are much easier to remove when things are fresh. Anything larger than a strawberry should be halved, sliced, or cubed.

Second, everything should be individually frozen. Freeze your veggies on a cookie sheet, then transfer them to a plastic bag. Otherwise, you'll end up chipping what you need off a single frozen block. When you zip the bag, also be sure to squeeze out as much air as you can, to minimize freezer burn.

*Don't forget to label your bags with the date and contents! You don't want to confuse bell peppers with jalapeños.*





Once you get the hang of freezing, you can try roasting your veggies before you freeze them.

OPTIONALLY, you can roast the vegetables before you freeze them!

For peppers, lay them skin-side-up. Roast until they blacken a little bit. Then put them in a bowl and let them steam for a few minutes. Scrape off the blackened skin with a knife.

For tomatoes, I like to cut them in half and put the skin side down. The top won't really caramelize. Bake until the tomatoes shrink down to about half their normal size. Half an hour to an hour, depending on the tomatoes. The bottoms of the tomatoes should have a nice caramelization. You don't even have to take them off the cookie sheet -- after letting it cool, just throw it right into the freezer.
