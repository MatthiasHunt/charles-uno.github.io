Mostly an affirmative case for why Biden is good, with some brief comparisons to Trump.






I am voting for Joe Biden. 

My goal here is to show, concretely, why.

If your priorities are anything like mine, I believe you should too.

Generally on the right side of issues. Pretty good at getting things done.

## What About Third Parties?

The two-party system is baked into our first-past-the-post voting system. Ross Perot won almost 20% of the vote in 1992, but did not earn a single electoral vote. 

## Israel and Palestine

<!--
First, a quick summary of [the world's most intractable conflict](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3965270):

Antisemitism in Europe induced large-scale Jewish immigration to the Middle East beginning in the 1800s. A Jewish state was proposed by Britain during WWI, then accepted by the UN following WWII. Arab states refused to recognize Israel. 

After some wars, Israel was left occupying the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank, both occupied by Arabs.

Relations have since normalized between Israel and [several Arab states][arab_states_recognize_israel]

Unique relationship might be part of the calculus.
Peace is unlikely as long as Hamas runs Gaza and Likud runs Israel. 
Going too deep...

Maybe Biden is [playing the long game][netanyahu_long_game], laying the groundwork for a lasting peace after Hamas and Likud are [out of power][dems_israel_elections].


Conspiracy theories. 

Netanyahu will likely die in prison if he ever loses an election. Hard to get leverage on him.

Easy to see Netanyahu align with Putin, as another right-wing leader happy to encroach on its neighbors. This would be very bad for the USA. Israel has been deeply entangled in US intelligence operations since 9-11. Israel also has NATO-level access to US military technology. 
Vetoed some stern letters from the UN, usually because he wants to see more blame pointed at Hamas.

"From the river to the sea" is literally calling for the destruction of Israel! 


-->

Hamas has been engaged in "[asymmetric warfare][hamas_goals]" against Israel for decades: [suicide bombers][wiki_hamas], [human shields][hamas_tunnels_not_bunkers], [sexual violence][hamas_rape], etc. 
Last October saw Hamas's largest attack yet: 1,000+ Israelis killed and hundreds more taken hostage.
Israel responded by invading Gaza to eradicate Hamas.
Over [30,000 have been killed][gaza_casualties], mostly Palestinian civilians.
Gaza's infrastructure has been devastated.
It's a humanitarian crisis.

Biden clearly supports Israel's campaign against Hamas. 
He sent arms. 
He vetoed some stern letters from the UN. 
But he is also clearly concerned about the war's collateral damage:

- He has repeatedly urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties, even threatening to [withhold arms][rafah_arms].
- Biden negotiated a [ceasefire in November][gaza_ceasefire_2023], and is [pursuing another][ceasefire_work_2024].
- He's pushing for [Palestinian statehood][palestinian_statehood] as part of a postwar plan.
- Biden [built a temporary port][gaza_port] off Gaza for faster delivery of humanitarian aid. 

It's not enough.
But it's a hell of a lot better than the alternative.
Trump's record on Palestine is horrific:

- Trump blocked [immigration][trump_muslim_ban] and [refugee resettlement][trump_refugees] from Muslim nations.
- Trump [withdrew US support][trump_peace_plan] for a two-state solution. 
- Trump and endorsed further [Israeli settlements][trump_peace_plan] on occupied land.
- Trump [halted humanitarian aid][trump_halted_aid] to Gaza.
- Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing decades of precedent. The status of Jerusalem is a long-standing obstacle to peace.

## Russia and Ukraine

Russia invaded and annexed Ukraine in 201x
At the time, Obama failed to enforce a red line

Biden has been much better
- Led western response. convinced Germany to cancel a Russian oil pipeline
- Clear guardrails to prevent direct conflict between nuclear powers
- Spending. Basically sending a bunch of old leftover supplies in exchange for clobbering our geopolitical adversary. zero American lives

Trump wanted to cut funding for Ukraine. Held up for months by Trump-aligned legislators


## Drone Strikes

95% decrease in drone strikes compared to Trump
