The first graph below shows some demographic data for US states on a linear scale. That means there's equal spacing between Mississippi (3 million people), Oklahoma (4 million), South Carolina (5 million), and Maryland (6 million). That's a perfectly sensible way to set up a graph, but unfortunately, it's illegible. To make room for Texas (30 million) and California (40 million), the rest of the states get squished together on the left margin. It's difficult to eyeball any sort of overall trend.

The second graph shows the exact same numbers on a logarithmic scale. Essentially, that means they're laid out in terms of multiplication instead of addition. The spacing between Montana (1 million people) and New Mexico (2 million) is the same as the spacing between Michigan (10 million) and New York (20 million). 




In this case, it makes the graph much more legible. 





Log scaling lets us take into account the difference between Vermont (0.6 million people), Rhode Island (1 million), and Nebraska (1.9 million) even though they're all small compared to California. 


Log scaling is common in scientific analysis, but makes sense in some everyday situations too. Population is a good example

China has quadruple the population of the USA, which has quadruple the population of Germany, which has quadruple the population of Sri Lanka, which has quadruple the population of New Zealand. Log scaling lets us look at all those differences at the same time. 




We can see that Texas is more-or-less in line with the data overall, and Hawaii is an outlier, rather than the other way around. 




A log scale lets us see the difference between Vermont and Nebraska, for example, even though they're both small compared to California. 

Log scales are helpful any time we want to look at data where most of the values are *very* small compared to the biggest. Populations are a good example. 



We care about the differences between Fargo (100k), Salt Lake City (200k), and Minneapolis (400k) even though they're all tiny compared to Shanghai (24 million). 





Shanghai has double the population of Mumbai, which has double the population of Rio, which has double the population of Chicago, which has double the population of Philadelphia, which has double the population of Denver, which has double the population of Minneapolis






China has ten times the population of Russia, which has ten times the population of Somalia, which has ten times the population of Estonia. 




Money is another



Populations are an easy example, as is any statistic that scales with population GDP




at relative differences rather than absolute differences. 

Florida has double the population of Ohio, which has double the population of Wisconsin, which has double the population of Kansas, which has double the population of Maine, which has double the population of Vermont. 





On a linear scale, those differences are lost because everything is small compared to California

New York has triple the population of Maryland, which has has triple the population of New Mexico, which has triple the population of Vermont. 

On a log scale, they're spaced equally, rather than all being squished to one side because they're small compared to California. 


It's much more legible. 





Basically, the horizontal axis is based on multiplication instead of addition. 

Log scales emphasize relative size rather than absolute size. 

This makes it much easier to see trends among the small and medium states. 



Linear scales are based on addition


Everything is small compared to California, but there's more to the story. 



Log scales make it possible to assess relative sizes 


Scaling logarithmigally also gives us a sense for relative sizes: Ohio has double the population of Wisconsin, which has double the population of Kansas, which has double the population of Maine, which has double the population of Vermont. 







valuable when we care about the differences between numbers that are small compared to the largest



The two graphs below show the same numbers in two different ways. On the right, the horizontal axis is linear. It goes from zero to forty million people, with 




The two graphs below show the same numbers in two different ways. On the right, the axes are linear. The horizontal axis goes from zero to two billion people, with one billion in the middle. The vertical axis goes from zero to twenty million square kilometers, with ten million in the middle. Linear axes are common and intuitive, but in this case the graph looks terrible. Fifteen of the twenty data points are squished into the bottom corner. It's impossible to eyeball any sort of trend.

On the left, the same data is shown on a logarithmic scale.

It's the same idea -- smaller on the left, bigger on the right -- but 



It's the same idea -- smaller on the left, bigger on the right -- but the numbering is based on multiplication instead of division.





Missouri has twice the population of Kansas, but they're both medium-sized states -- way bigger than Wyoming, way smaller than California. 








It's impossible to eyeball any sort of trend -- and eyeballing trends is the whole reason graphs exist in the first place!



instead of being based on addition, it's based on multiplication








Both plots below show the same data. The one on the right uses a linear scale, meaning that the range from one to two million people takes up the same amount of space as the range from ten to eleven million. Linear scales often make sense, but in this case the plot looks terrible.


Fifteen of our twenty data points are squished into the bottom corner, which makes it impossible to eyeball any sort of trend -- and eyeballing trends is the whole reason graphs exist!


The figure on the right shows the same data using a logarithmic scale (actually a log-log scale)










People are good at eyeballing straight-line trends.

if you're trying to show the relationship between two things, it'll be easiest for your audience to understand if you can make it look linear-ish.





time is generally good for linear plots. a second is a second no matter when it is


money often belongs on a geometric scale. $10k is a lot of money if you're poor and not very much money if you're rich

population goes on a log scale.


want to be able to compare Norway (5 million people) to Canada (37M) to the USA (330M) to China (1.4B) on the same plot







exponential trends presented on a linear scale can give the false impression that that a trend "takes off" after a certain value, because everything up to there is squished against the axis




as the values get bigger, the buckets also get bigger


$40k to $80k is a big jump. $500k to $540k is a much smaller jump








look at *relative* change rather than *absolute* change






Not everyone is good with numbers, and that's OK.


important for number people to be good at communicating



Time is linear.

Distance is often linear

Temperature is linear (until you get into astrophysics anyway)

Money also fits naturally on a log scale. one percent, tenths of one percent

Difference between 1%, 5%, and 10% is very significant. 18/20 candidates are below 10% in the polling average, but they're all squished into the left third of the plot!

> And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the number of words spoken by each of the candidates roughly correlated with their polling averages over both nights, with the correlation being somewhat stronger during the second debate.

> But there were notable outliers, like Booker and Harris, who both spoke more than their polling averages might have predicted. Sanders and Warren were also outliers, in that they spoke less than their standing in the polls might have suggested. And then, of course, thereâ€™s Andrew Yang, who spoke the least out of all the candidates even though he was in the middle of the pack in polling average.


In their plot, it's not at all clear that Yang is in the "middle of the pack." But on a log scale, he's a clear outlier.
