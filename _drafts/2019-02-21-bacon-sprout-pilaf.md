- <span class="metric">1 L</span><span class="imperial">4 c</span> cooked black[^1] rice
- <span class="metric">100 mL</span><span class="imperial">1/2 c</span> slivered almonds
- <span class="metric">100 mL</span><span class="imperial">1/2 c</span> dried cranberries (optional)
- Black pepper

[^1]: Brown rice works too, but the earthier flavor of black rice (sometimes called forbidden rice) does a lot of work here.

Cook the bacon in a large skillet, low and slow, to render out as much grease as possible. Once the bacon is crispy, remove it from the pan. Leave the grease.

Turn the heat up to medium and add the sprouts to the bacon fat. Season with black pepper to taste. Cook, stirring intermittently, until the sprouts brown and soften -- about 15 minutes.

Return the bacon to the pan, and gently stir in the rice, cranberries, and almonds. (Depending on the size of your skillet, it may be necessary to do this one half at a time.)

Makes six lunch-sized portions.
