In a large skillet, start the garbanzo beans on high heat with a splash of oil. Stir intermittently until they start to brown, about 5 minutes.

Turn it down to medium heat and add the onion and sausage. Ideally, it should be a sausage with strong flavor, and not too lean, so there's enough fat and spice to go around. If the pan starts to look dry, add more oil.

Cook the sausage through, then add the kale. It'll seem like way too much, and probably overflow your skillet. Fold it in gently. After a few minutes it'll cook down. The color should also become much more vibrant.
