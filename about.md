Welcome!

I'm Charles.
I like figuring out how things work -- and how they could be tweaked to work a little bit better.
My background is in [plasma physics](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/181780), and I currently work on messaging infrastructure at Instagram.

This site is half portfolio, half sandbox.
I use it to show off content I've created and projects I'm proud of.
I try to keep things looking presentable, but no promises... sometimes my web development skills are just good enough to make a mess out of everything.
