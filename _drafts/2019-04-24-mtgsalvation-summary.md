The first Modern tournament I ever played was a PPTQ. I won it, despite knowing nothing about the format. Then I won the RPTQ. Then, despite a few embarrassing punts, I went 6-4 in the Modern portion of PT RIX. The secret behind my success, honestly, was Valakut. The deck is resilient and redundant, making it incredibly friendly to beginners. All the cards are basically lands. You just keep putting them on the table and eventually your opponent scoops it up. Half the time you don't even have to understand what they're playing! 

The downside of "resilient and redundant" is that Valakut can get repetitive. Everything happens at sorcery speed. There are no tricks to dig for, or cantrips to dig with. The deck spends a lot of time on autopilot: ramp spell, ramp spell, ramp spell, game over.

Skill still matters, of course. I'm a lot better at mulliganing and fetch sequencing than I was back then -- and sometimes I still mess them up. But Valakut decks spend a lot of time on autopilot: ramp spell, ramp spell, ramp spell, game over.

If the game goes long, just keep playing pointing Valakut triggers at your opponent's face until they run out of counterspells.

Valakut is a good deck for a newcomer to Modern. All your cards are basically lands. Just keep putting them on the table and eventually your opponent will scoop up their cards. Half the time you don't even have to care what they're playing!

This isn't meant as criticism. The first Modern tournament I ever played was a PPTQ. I won it with Valakut, despite knowing nothing about the format. Then I won the RPTQ, flew to Spain, and went 6-4 in the Modern portion of PT RIX. 

The deck's not bad. And resolving Primeval Titan is a rush. But there just aren't that many choices -- it could basically be played by a computer.
