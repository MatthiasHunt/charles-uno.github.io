In a large, deep pan, start the bacon low and slow, rendering out as much fat as possible. When the bacon is just about done, stir in the onion. Season generously with black pepper and rosemary. Cook, stirring intermittently, until the onions reduce by half.

Pour in the broth and water[^1], then add the rice, lentils, carrots, and celery. Bring to a boil. Boil uncovered, stirring once in a while, until the rice and lentils are cooked and the carrots are soft. This should take about an hour.

[^1]: The broth-to-water ratio can be adjusted to taste. More broth means more flavor, but too much can make the wild rice stubborn about cooking through. This may have to do with acidity.

Stir in the kale. Within a few minutes, it should soften and its color should brighten notably. Serve with bread -- or pack it up for lunches!

Makes six servings (plus one for the cook).
