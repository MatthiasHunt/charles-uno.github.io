Under no circumstances should a child in America[^1] be homeless. I believe strongly that the government (whether federal, state, or local) has a moral obligation to ensure that every child in the country has a safe place to sleep -- even if doing so is expensive, even if the money goes to a slumlord, and even if the child has a criminal record. Waste and abuse are legitimate concerns, and we should design policy to mitigate them, but fear of fraud is no excuse to let a child sleep on the street.

[^1]: Child homelessness *anywhere* is morally appalling, but let's start here.




Unless you've studied homelessness specifically, 





Lifelong trauma. PTSD? Can't perform in school. Barrier to becoming a productive member of society as an adult.


Homeless youth are at high risk for sexual assault, or even being conscripted into sex work.

Child homelessness is a moral indictment on all of us -- not to mention that it makes us poorer in the literal sense. How do you expect a homeless child to perform in school, get a job, and become a productive member of society?









Next is the question of implementation.

If a homeless child is accompanied by a parent, should we be obligated to house the parent as well? What if they've got a criminal record? What if it's a cousin or uncle? Do we withdraw benefits on a child's eighteenth birthday? Who's in charge of verifying blood relations and birth dates?




Waste and fraud are legitimate concerns, but they're secondary. The primary concern is ensuring that every child has a roof over their head as soon as possible.





In some states, we could end homelessness *today*. There are more empty homes than there are people without homes. A few years ago, Utah did just that. They gave each person experiencing homelessness a roof and set them up with a social worker to get them back on their feet. The results were staggering.

Not only that, but it didn't cost them anything! The cost of the apartments and social workers was offset by fewer police calls, jail stays, and emergency room visits.

Homelessness has long-term economic costs too. Children without a safe place to sleep can't perform at school.
