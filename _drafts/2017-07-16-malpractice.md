When surveyed, most Americans say they would prefer to spend their last days in the comfort of their own homes. But in practice, [the majority die in hospitals](https://palliative.stanford.edu/home-hospice-home-care-of-the-dying-patient/where-do-americans-die/), surrounded by unfamiliar people and machines. Worse still, many who die in hospitals shouldn't be dying at all. [Over 100k](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/09/20/224507654/how-many-die-from-medical-mistakes-in-u-s-hospitals) American lives are lost each year due to medical errors -- unnecessary surgery, incorrect prescription, etc -- which puts these errors among the 10 most [common causes of death](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) in the US, up there with heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.

Medical errors account for a similar death rate in other wealthy nations -- [Canada](http://globalnews.ca/news/3026275/1-in-18-canadian-hospital-patients-experience-harm-from-preventable-errors-study/), the [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/14/avoidable-deaths-nhs-hospitals-study), and [Germany](http://www.upi.com/17000-die-in-Germany-from-medical-errors/52721267847072/) for instance. And yet, it's unheard-of for doctors to face criminal charges for murder or manslaughter.

To be clear, this is a good thing. It should be very difficult for a doctor, doing their job in good faith, to be convicted of a felony. Doctors are routinely faced with life-and-death decisions; if mistakes opened them up to criminal prosecution, we'd quickly find ourselves with understaffed hospitals. Thousands would go to prison; this would be particularly devastating to rural areas, many of which already face [physician shortages](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/01/2016-15678/lists-of-designated-primary-medical-care-mental-health-and-dental-health-professional-shortage-areas). The suicide rate among doctors is currently [double](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/why-do-doctors-commit-suicide.html) that of the population overall; the constant threat of a murder charge would likely push it even higher. And it's hard to imagine America's best and brightest stepping up to fill all these vacancies -- if doctors are treated like criminals, veterinary medicine suddenly looks much more appealing.

Plus, practicality aside, it would be problematic to punish an individual doctor for the failure of an institution. Suppose I'm a medical student -- but not a great one. I have some misconceptions about how guts are supposed to fit together. But you give me a medical license anyway, hire me as a surgeon, and put a scalpel in my hand. When I inevitably botch an operation, there's blood on your hands as well as mine.

Crucially, shielding doctors from murder charges is only half the story; the other half is ensuring justice for the victims. When a slip of the surgeon's wrist kills or cripples a parent, perhaps the surgeon isn't a murderer -- but certainly the family has been wronged.

The accepted solution is for victims to take up a [medical malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice_in_the_United_States) lawsuit. This is clearly not ideal. For every dollar paid out for malpractice, [54 cents](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa054479) are spent on administrative expenses. The [cost of malpractice insurance](http://doctorly.org/cost-vs-reward-of-opening-a-medical-private-practice/) can make it difficult for doctors to go into private practice. [Most doctors](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1012370) will be sued for malpractice during their careers, and many of those claims will be frivolous.

But despite these flaws, the medical malpractice system






- compensatory damages, to help the family recover
- punitive damages, to make a statement that what happened was wrong

medical malpractice system is litigious and wasteful. momentum behind reform in the 90s?

but it's certainly better than nothing

admission of fault would be a victory for activists like BLM, without throwing pawns under the bus

let's belabor that point:

Suppose I'm a lousy medical student, with some misconceptions about how guts are supposed to fit together. If you hand me a medical license, hire me as a surgeon, and send me into an operating room, there's a decent chance the patient will die. I'm sure the victim's family would love to charge me with murder -- but I'm really just the tip of the iceberg.

How could I have known better? I was assessed by experts, and they said I was ready.

in July 2016, officer Yanez panicked after pulling over Philando Castile in Minnesota. He fatally shot a nonviolent, law-abiding man in front of a child.

Why was he in that situation?

Someone higher up the chain told Yanez he was ready for traffic duty. They gave him a gun and a squad car and sent him out into the night. That should never have happened.

Medical doctor is a life-and-death job.

- Emergency response
- High-impact choices
- Frequent use of dangerous tools

Sometimes, a doctor messes up and kills someone.

- What do we do?
- How do we judge a reasonable amount of collateral damage?
- How do we weigh the doctor's intentions -- cruelty vs negligence vs being in over their head?
- Under what circumstances do we punish the doctor personally, rather than (for example) allowing the hospital to absorb the liability?

In general, liability is absorbed by hospitals, not individuals

- Litigation is expensive and inefficient
- It is the responsibility of the institution to make sure its employees are up to their jobs?

We trust doctors with our lives

Doesn't really make sense to hold police to the same standards as civilians when it comes to use of deadly force. we entrust police, as emergency responders, with deadly force. sometimes it will be misapplied.

in the same way, there's a difference in scrutiny between a doctor prescribing narcotics and a drug dealer dispensing the same drugs.

Challenge -- it's hard to punish the police as an institution because they are publicly funded. You can't cut into their profits like you can with a private hospital. Underfunded police departments become predatory; see the DOJ's report on Ferguson. This seems surmountable -- how do countries with public healthcare handle medical malpractice?

Policing is a dangerous job, but not to the extent you might think. Lower mortality rate than truck drivers, fishers, or pilots. Most deaths are car accidents, not homicides.

Not all interactions need to be life-and-death. Police shouldn't be killing people during traffic stops, just like you shouldn't fear for your life when the doctor is treating your sprained ankle.

Maybe the gun should be in the trunk, instead of at the hip.

https://fee.org/articles/by-the-numbers-how-dangerous-is-it-to-be-a-cop/

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/08/22/americas-10-deadliest-jobs-2/#2438ddf3424b

Police officers have a mortality rate of 11 per 100k. That's lower than truck drivers, construction workers, pilots, etc.

About half of police deaths are homicides. That's about the same as the murder rate of US cities.

Philando Castile verdict (and police shootings in general)
- The job of a police officer involves making life-and-death choices. Sometimes they will mess up, and people will die.
- As much as possible, it would be good to reframe the job so that traffic stops, etc, are NOT viewed as life-and-death. Maybe keep the gun in the trunk.
- When other life-and-death jobs (for example, doctors) mess up and kill people, we don't throw the individual in jail. We file a malpractice lawsuit. The institution typically absorbs the cost -- they probably shouldn't have put an unqualified person in the position to make that mistake.
- Malpractice payouts typically include both compensatory and punitive damages. This seems great -- it carries the important admission that what happened was WRONG.
- But how do you apply this to police? You can't hit their profits, since they're funded by the state. And if you cut their funds, you end up with predatory policing like they talked about in the DOJ Ferguson report.

How do nations with government-funded healthcare handle medical malpractice?

https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/why-do-doctors-commit-suicide.html

400 doctors commit suicide each year

https://www.statista.com/statistics/186260/total-doctors-of-medicine-in-the-us-since-1949/

roughly 1M doctors in the US

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_the_United_States

roughly 1M police officers in the US

https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/7/pdfs/04-1038.pdf

only ~10 doctors per year in the US have job-related deaths
