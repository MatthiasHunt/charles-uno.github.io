At present, Mardu Pyromancer is one of the top five decks in Modern[^1]; it usually plays two or three copies of [[Blood Moon]] in the main. Ponza and Blue Moon -- dedicated [[Blood Moon]] decks -- are both in the top twenty. [[Blood Moon]] also sees sideboard play in Hollow One, Storm, and even [Jeskai](http://www.starcitygames.com/decks/121783). By my count, [[Blood Moon]] sees about as much play in Modern as format staples like [[Tarmogoyf]], [[Aether Vial]], and [[Cryptic Command]].

[^1]: According to MTGGoldfish rankings based on top finishes.

Unlike any other format staple, however[^2], [[Blood Moon]] provides a [consistently horrible experience](https://twitter.com/MtGMatthias/status/1008420646450278401). The card combos with itself to lock opponents out of the game, often on turn two. It's like showing up to a chess tournament, ready to test your skills, only to have your opponent flip the table and punch you in the face.

[^2]: With the possible exception of [[Chalice of the Void]].

The go-to defense -- "[[Blood Moon]] punishes greedy mana bases" -- is a load of malarkey. Playing nonbasic lands in Modern isn't greedy. In fact, playing a bunch of *basic* lands in Modern is *weird*. Decks usually play a few to respect [[Ghost Quarter]] and [[Path to Exile]], but the nonbasic lands available in Modern are better, more interesting, and more fun. 

Look at UW Control. The deck plays two colors with no splash. Even so, fewer than half its lands are basic. It uses [[Flooded Strand]] to fuel [[Logic Knot]], [[Field of Ruin]] to disrupt Tron, and [[Celestial Colonade]] as a resilient win condition. These choices demonstrate innovative deckbuilding, and lead to interesting in-game choices. But the deck can also be locked out by [[Blood Moon]], left unable to cast its numerous answers. 

That last part is important: if [[Blood Moon]] turned nonbasic lands into forests, plains, or islands, it wouldn't be nearly so problematic. But red isn't allowed to answer enchantments. Not only does [[Blood Moon]] take a jackhammer to the opponent's resources, but it protects itself while doing so. This is why nobody cares about [[Magus of the Moon]] -- it doesn't protect itself from [[Lightning Bolt]]. 



Hearthstone. All cards do something. 








Hollow One is another example: a two-color deck without demanding mana requirements. It plays [[Bloodghast:double-black]] and [[Flamewake Phoenix:double-red]] cards, but doesn't really want to cast them. The deck plays eighteen lands, only three of them nonbasic.

# Basic lands aren't good enough for Modern

Blood Moon isn't about "punishing greedy mana bases" -- it punishes all mana bases that aren't specifically built to handle Blood Moon.

People play a few basics for Ghost Quarter and Path to Exile, but basic lands just aren't very good. Lands can do too many other things.

Hollow One is a two-color deck with pretty easy mana requirements. The only double-red and double-black costs are Flamewake Phoenix and Bloodghast, which usually don't get cast. It plays 18 lands, 15 of them nonbasic.

Burn is nearly mono-red. It plays 20 lands, 17 of them nonbasic.

UW plays two colors and cares (a *lot*) about preserving its life total. Plus it plays a full set of Field of Ruin. It plays 25 lands, 15 of them nonbasic.

And that's ok! Basic lands are boring! Blizzard was on to something when they pulled the lands out of the deck for Hearthstone. Now all the cards do something.

Raging Ravine is usually better than Plains. It's also more interesting.










Nonbasic lands are better than basics.

Nonbasic lands lead to interesting play decisions. They're fun.



Even in a two-color deck like UW Control, 60% of the lands are nonbasic



Coming up with your mana base is interesting. Gameplay decisions with Colonnade and Field of Ruin are interesting. Basic lands don't have any text on them.







Blood Moon is a mana denial tool.

Would we want Wasteland in Modern?








# Blood Moon combos with itself.

It would be far less egregious if it turned nonbasics into plains, since white is allowed to deal with enchantments.

This is why nobody cares about Magus of the Moon -- you can just Bolt him.

It forms a soft lock, often on turn 2.
