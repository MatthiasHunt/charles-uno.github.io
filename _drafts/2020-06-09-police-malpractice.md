> This post was originally written in 2017, after police killed [Philando Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile) in my old neighborhood. It was updated in 2020 after police killed [George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_George_Floyd) less than a mile from our home. Minnesota police also killed [Jamal Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Jamar_Clark) and [Dominic Felder](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/10/25/excessive-force-verdict) within memory, both of whom were unarmed.

Doctors make life-and-death decisions millions of times each year. Sometimes they get it wrong, and people die. Unnecessary surgery, incorrect prescriptions, and other medical errors account for over [100k American lives lost](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/09/20/224507654/how-many-die-from-medical-mistakes-in-u-s-hospitals) each year -- more than car accidents and guns combined. However, despite how often Americans[^1] die from medical errors, it's exceptionally rare for a doctor to face criminal charges for murder or manslaughter.

[^1]: Medical errors aren't a uniquely American phenomenon. [Canada](http://globalnews.ca/news/3026275/1-in-18-canadian-hospital-patients-experience-harm-from-preventable-errors-study/), the [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/14/avoidable-deaths-nhs-hospitals-study), and [Germany](http://www.upi.com/17000-die-in-Germany-from-medical-errors/52721267847072/) have similar rates.

Victims of medical errors typically seek justice in civil court for [medical malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice_in_the_United_States). The system is by no means perfect. It's [expensive](http://doctorly.org/cost-vs-reward-of-opening-a-medical-private-practice/), [bureaucratic](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa054479), and many suits are [frivilous](https://www.irmi.com/articles/expert-commentary/medical-malpractice-the-high-cost-of-meritless-claims). But in terms of advancing reforms and saving lives, there are few reasons to prefer civil suits to leveling criminal charges against individual doctors. For one, civil suits are more winnable for victims. It's one thing to show that a patient was harmed and deserves compensation. Convincing a jury that a doctor's misconduct rises to the level of a felony is a bigger lift. Putting a price on medical malpractice also creates a financial incentive for reform. Hospitals take out insurance policies to cover the cost of malpractice. More liability means higher premiums. [Hospitals save money by reducing liabilities](http://m.hartfordbusiness.com/article/20140428/PRINTEDITION/304249935/hospitals-battle-medical-malpractice-costs) -- for example, by [training staff](http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20151122_Medmal_head_here_in_two_lines_of_36_pt.html) to avoid medical errors.

If you go to the gym, your health instance gets cheaper. If you update your brakes, your car insurance gets cheaper. If you fix your roof, your homeowner's insurance gets cheaper. The insurance company creates incentives for responsible long-term behavior, and it's not because they care about your health or safety. They make their money by identifying liabilities and quantifying the risk of catastrophe.

*[George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_George_Floyd) was killed in police custody less than a mile from our home.*

American police departments pay out millions of dollars each year for wrongful deaths[^2]. Clearly, there's money to be saved by reducing police violence. But there's a catch: police departments are publicly funded. There are no shareholders to push back against reckless spending. Police departments may even piggyback on the [city's insurance](http://www.savmn.com/DocumentCenter/View/568/6-26-17--Joint-Statement-City-of-St-Anthony-and-Valerie-Castile-as-Trustee-for-Philando-Castile) policy, further insulating them from the costs they incur.

[^2]: Police paid out $1.8M after killing [Dominic Felder](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/10/25/excessive-force-verdict) in 2006. [Jamal Clark](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/08/09/attorneys-for-jamar-clark-family-members-confirm-agreement-on-200000-settlement)'s death in 2014 cost taxpayers another $200k. [Philando Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile)'s wrongful death was settled for $3M in 2017. And that's just Minnesota!

One path forward is to require each officer to hold liability insurance, rather than being covered by the department or city. The officers who killed George Floyd were [repeatedly reprimanded](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/11/19/the-officers-in-the-jamar-clark-shooting) for excessive force. The officers who killed Jamal Clark had a [history of violence](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/11/19/the-officers-in-the-jamar-clark-shooting) as well. Each of these men was a multimillion-dollar settlement waiting to happen, which any insurance agent would have been able to see. Prohibitive lability costs should have made them unemployable as police officers long before they had a chance to kill, regardless of support from the department or union.

Public opinion matters too. Police ultimately report to the mayor, who reports to the voters. This is the part where criminal charges may hurt more than they help. Under [today's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_immunity), it's [hard to convict the police](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/01/minnesota-attorney-general-hard-to-convict-police-293920). They're [rarely even indicted](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/). But criminal cases attract far more public attention than civil suits (see below). A [consistent majority](http://www.gallup.com/poll/213869/confidence-police-back-historical-average.aspx) of Americans report a great deal of confidence in the police, and that confidence is unlikely to be shaken when the climactic headline reads, "[Officer who shot Philando Castile found not guilty on all counts](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/16/us/philando-castile-trial-verdict/index.html)."

*In terms of [search traffic](https://g.co/trends/9eJeo), the climax of the Philando Castile case was Officer Yanez's acquittal. The family's $3M wrongful death settlement with the city received comparably little attention.*

TODO: wrap it all up.
