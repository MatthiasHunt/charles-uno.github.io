At present, Mardu Pyromancer is one of the top five decks in Modern[^1]; it usually plays two or three copies of [[Blood Moon]] in the main. Ponza and Blue Moon -- dedicated [[Blood Moon]] decks -- are both in the top twenty. It also sees sideboard play in Hollow One, Storm, and even [Jeskai](http://www.starcitygames.com/decks/121783). By my count, [[Blood Moon]] sees about as much play in Modern as format staples like [[Tarmogoyf]], [[Aether Vial]], and [[Cryptic Command]]. 

Unlike any other format staple, however[^2], [[Blood Moon]] provides a [consistently horrible experience](https://twitter.com/MtGMatthias/status/1008420646450278401). 


It doesn't punish greedy mana bases -- it punishes conventional mana bases. 

The cost of respecting Blood Moon is so high that decks typically don't do it. 

Play around Blood Moon not with more basics, but with more fetches. 

The card combos with itself to soft-lock opponents out of the game, often on turn two.

# Blood Moon is a format staple

Mardu maindecks 2-3 of them, and is one of the top five decks right now. Ponza and Blue Moon are also in the top twenty. 

That means Blood Moon probably sees about as much play as Tarmogoyf, Aether Vial, Cryptic Command, and Thalia. It's not a fringe card. 


# Blood Moon combos with itself. 

It would be far less egregious if it turned nonbasics into plains, since white is allowed to deal with enchantments. 

This is why nobody cares about Magus of the Moon -- you can just Bolt him. 

It forms a soft lock, often on turn 2. 


# Basic lands aren't good enough for Modern

Blood Moon isn't about "punishing greedy mana bases" -- it punishes all mana bases that aren't specifically built to handle Blood Moon. 

People play a few basics for Ghost Quarter and Path to Exile, but basic lands just aren't very good. Lands can do too many other things. 

Hollow One is a two-color deck with pretty easy mana requirements. The only double-red and double-black costs are Flamewake Phoenix and Bloodghast, which usually don't get cast. It plays 18 lands, 15 of them nonbasic. 

Burn is nearly mono-red. It plays 20 lands, 17 of them nonbasic. 

UW plays two colors and cares (a *lot*) about preserving its life total. Plus it plays a full set of Field of Ruin. It plays 25 lands, 15 of them nonbasic. 

And that's ok! Basic lands are boring! Blizzard was on to something when they pulled the lands out of the deck for Hearthstone. Now all the cards do something. 

Raging Ravine is usually better than Plains. It's also more interesting.
