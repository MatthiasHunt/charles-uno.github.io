Cut **1 navel orange** into pieces and remove the seeds.

Put the orange into a food processor with **250ml (1 cup)** sugar.

Blend briefly to mix.

Add **1l (4 cups, about a pound) raw cranberries**.

Pulse until the relish has the desired consistency.

Let it sit overnight in the fridge. The sugar will draw the juice out of the berries, improving both the flavor and the color.
