Crispix is a top-notch snack mix ingredient. 
But the recipe included on the box is, honestly, worrying.
Please don't show up to a party with something that looks like this:

With a little bit more effort, you can create something that is much more delicious --- not to mention much more appetizing. 
The recipe below is a guaranteed crowd pleaser.

- 3 c Crispix
- 2 c Cheez-Its
- 2 c Wheat Chex
- 2 c Mini Pretzels
- 1 c Peanuts
- 1/2 c Butter (1 stick)
- 1/2 c Brown Sugar
- 1/2 t Onion Powder
- 1/2 t Garlic Powder
- 1/2 t Smoked Paprika
- 1/2 t Black Pepper
- 1/4 t Cayenne Pepper
- 4 T Sesame Seeds

Preheat oven to 250 F.

Measure cereal, crackers, pretzels, and peanuts into a large bowl.

Melt the butter completely in the microwave.
Mix in the sugar, spices, and sesame seeds.
Pour half the butter mixture over the cereal mixture, toss gently, then repeat with the other half.

Spread the concoction thinly on sheet trays[^1] and bake until crispy (about an hour).
You're essentially just cooking off the moisture from the butter.

[^1]: If you haven't got enough sheet trays to spread it thinly, you can use a 9x13 pan instead. If you do, stir the mix every 20 minutes or so while it bakes. Otherwise the stuff on the bottom might get soggy.
