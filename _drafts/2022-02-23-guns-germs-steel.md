At the Massacre of Cajamarca, Pizarro and a few hundred Spaniards killed thousands of Incas and captured Emperor Atahualpa without suffering a single casualty.
Then they marched on the capital city of Cusco, killing thousands more warriors along the way.
The Incan empire --- which at the time was [more populous than Spain][1500_populations] --- fell shortly thereafter.

[1500_populations]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_1500

The Spanish invasion was so successful, in part, because the conquistadors wore steel armor and rode horses.
They also carried (and were resistant to) deadly diseases such as smallpox.
Written language allowed Pizarro to model his tactics after the victories of Cortés.
And of course, Europe had the political structures to send expeditions around the world in the first place.
In his 1997 bestseller *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, Jared Diamond digs into human history (and pre-history) to explain why all these technologies[^1] developed in Eurasia[^2] while humans on other continents developed fewer or none of them.

[^1]: For lack of a better word, "technology" is used broadly here. It includes agriculture, livestock domestication, written language, centralized political structures, diseases, and more.

[^2]: The author uses "Eurasia" to refer jointly to Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The mediterranean coast of Africa is sometimes included as well. These regions have been linked by migration and trade for thousands of years.

Diamond's answer, in a word, is food.
At the end of the last ice age (about 13,000 years ago) humans worldwide lived in nomadic hunter-gatherer societies.
Populations grew as the climate warmed.
Around the same time, mammoths and many other large animals [went extinct][extinction].
With more mouths to feed, and less game to hunt, humans gradually transitioned to sedentary societies reliant on food production.

<!--
Right off the bat, the author addresses the elephant in the room: it's not about race.
He emphatically rejects the idea that people in Eurasia were innately superior to those in Australia, the Americas, or Sub-Saharan Africa.
Instead, Diamond writes from the perspective of a biologist studying the human species overall.
The emphasis is not on individual people, or even groups, so much as the environments faced by early humans in different regions.
-->

The shift from hunter-gatherer society to sedentary food production was accidental, slow, and hungry.
Archeological records suggest that early food producers ate less and died younger than hunter-gatherers.
But once food production was established, it snowballed.
Food production allowed rapid population growth and large population density.
Surplus food (and food storage) also freed up resources for specialized roles.
Food producers were the first human societies to have full-time artisans and bookkeepers --- as well as soldiers.
Neighboring hunter-gatherer societies were assimilated or displaced.

Diamond argues that food production was critically important to the development of each technology listed up top.
Tracking and allocating bulk quantifies of food gave rise to writing and politics.
Wars between professional armies demanded new weapons and armor.
Close proximity to livestock was a vector for new diseases.
Pizarro's technological advantage over Atahualpa comes as no surprise when we consider that wheat (domesticated 8,000 BCE) gave Spain a 4,000 year head start compared to the Inca Empire's corn (domesticated 4,000 BCE).


This brings us to the "real" question of the book: why did the rise and spread of food production differ between continents?


Let's start with geography.
Eurasia is the largest continent by far.
It's also the most temperate, which is good for wild grasses and legumes.
The other continents are smaller, and their temperate regions are divided by deserts and rainforests.
As a result, Eurasia has the best selection of wild plant species suitable for domestication as staple crops.

Wheat, native to the Fertile Crescent, is high in protein and easy to domesticate[^6].
Millet (a staple grain in Africa) produces far fewer calories for the same amount of effort.
Corn required such extensive domestication that it barely resembles its wild ancestor.
The author further argues (per archeological evidence) that hunter-gatherers were deeply familiar with nearby native plants.
It's very unlikely that early humans in the Americas overlooked a better wild grass than corn.

[^6]: Wild wheat stalks shatter when ripe, dropping the kernels on the ground. A single mutation kept the stalks in tact. Harvesting the whole stalk was much easier, so the mutated wheat was more likely to be harvested (and spread).

Eurasia also had the best native animals for livestock.
There are about 150 species of large plant-eating mammal on the planet.
The vast majority of them are mean (zebra), panicky (antelope), territorial (deer), slow to mature (elephant), or reluctant to breed in captivity (vicuña[^5]).
Only about a dozen species are well-suited to domestication, and almost all of them (camels, cows, donkeys, goats, horses, pigs, sheep, and water buffalo) are native to Eurasia.
Llamas and alpacas, native to the Americas, aren't strong enough to pull a plow.
Dogs were domesticated by early humans worldwide, but only protein-starved societies ever resorted to eating them.


[^5]: When this book was written, it was believed that llamas and alpacas were domesticated from the same species. More recent analysis suggests instead that the alpaca is descended from the vicuña.









horse is native to Ukraine
cow is native to India

not every better species, but you can't build a civilization on just apples
enough staples were enough better



Not only were the native species in Eurasia better suited for domestication, but the geography made it easier for food production (as well as later technologies) to spread.
plants are sensitive to day length
wheat could grow from spain to the tibetan plateau
meanwhile corn from mexico doesn't grow north of texas

large connected biomes?
llamas never made it past the ithmus of panama
corn beans squash (the three sisters) were domesticated in central america around X, but did not spread to the north american plains until 900 AD
CA climate is perfect but food production never arrived in pre-colonial times

---

llamas were domesticated in the andes, but never crossed the panama ithmus to mesoamerica
corn and beans were domesticated in mesoamerica, but took thousands of years to cross the desert to the mississippi river valley
california has an ideal climate, but food production never showed up

Diamond's answer, in a word, is food.
steel armor
horses
diseases
writing
political structures
can all be traced back to humans transitioning from nomadic hunter-gatherers to sedentary food producers.

The first food production was in the fertile crescent, shortly after the end of the last ice age.
as the climate warmed, human populations grew
mammoths went extinct

wheat and cows were domesticates thousands of miles apart

syria to india is 3,000 miles
mexico city to kansas city 2500 miles

Early evidence for food production in the Fertile Crescent dates to about 10,000 years ago; by 8,000 years ago, the Eurasian continent was covered with sedentary population centers dependent on food production.
By about 8,000 years ago, Eurasia was covered with sedentary population centers dependent on food production.
Wheat and peas were domesticated in the Fertile Crescent by about 10,000 years ago, while corn and beans were domesticated in the Americas by about 6,000 years ago.

The first evidence of human food production is from the Fertile Crescent 10,000 years ago.
Food production was developed independently in the Americas, but not until much later, about 6,000 years ago.
Sub-Saharan Africa also developed it later.
Australia didn't develop food production at all.

Rice, soybeans, and pigs were domesticated in China[^3] around the same time.

[^3]: The author devotes a lot of pages to the emergence of food production in the Fertile Crescent, including analysis of the climate and geography. Similar analysis is lacking for China, even though crops were domesticated there around the same time. It's possible that archeological evidence from China was more difficult to access in the 1990s. This is my biggest frustration with the book.

Food production was developed much later in the Americas (corn and beans) and Sub-Saharan Africa (millet and lentils), and was not developed at all in Australia.
Diamond discusses this issue at length, and grounds his arguments in the geography and native species.

- eurasia has the best species
- also the best variety of species
- also easiest spread of species

He then argues that Eurasia presented early humans with the best native species, the best variety of native species, and the easiest spread of

Eurasia is by far the largest continent on the planet.
It's also largely temperate, and its temperate zones are well connected.
It also has the largest and most contiguous temperate zones.
Australia is mostly desert.
Temperate zones in Africa and the Americas are small and disjoint in comparison, with deserts and rainforests between them.
which is good for staple crops.

[^4]: humans on several continents eat acorns, but domestication efforts have repeatedly failed. trees are slow to grow, bad attributes depending on multiple genes, hard to compete with squirrels planting acorns everywhere

- Wheat, barley, and peas are easy to domesticate. corn much more difficult. millet less productive
- Fertile crescent is the largest and most varied mediterranean zone on the planet. no surprise that you have a good variety of grasses there.
- You can't build a food production society with just one species.
- east-west axis. plants are very sensitive to day length. easy to move them east-west but north-south is tougher
- Eurasia is a huge continent with relatively few barriers. no sahara, no mexican desert
- Wheat, barley, and peas are amazing crops. Large seeds, high protein, easy to domesticate. Compare to corn, millet.
- A single crop doesn't do it. California has a perfect climate for food production, and apples are native to the area, but you can't build a civilization on just apples.
- Animals are important for supplemental protein, cloth, manure, and (eventually) pulling plows and carts. minimal animals suitable for domestication outside eurasia.

linguistics. did farming spread or did farme*rs* spread. also skeletal structure

similar climates: south africa, mediterranean, california, sw australia

first farmers worked harder, were smaller, died younger than hunter gatherers

shifting from mostly wild food to mostly cultivated took thousands of years

8500bc vs 18500bs. wild game less abundant. wild cereals more abundant due to climate. technology for storage. density high enough to value calories per acre. p112

some areas suitable for food production but HGs never displaced due to geography. CA separated by desert from AZ. south africa with a different climate from tropical bantu crops. australia separated by sea from NG, indonesia. p113

wild almonds are bitter and toxic, but it's just one gene. early humans would find non-bitter ones by accident, interact preferrentially, propagate by accident then intentionally. p118

barley, wheat, peas, lentils, flax, poppies. natural seed dispersal threw seeds on the ground. single gene caused that to fail, making them much easier to harvest. accidental domestication since those are the ones that got propagated. p120

food production, rising density. chicken and egg. p111

table by crop type. cereal, bean, tuber. p126

plowing important for monoculture. p128

some species we failed to domesticate until recently. acorns, strawberries. p129

All staple foods were domesticated thousands of years ago. Some recent fruits and veggies but no grains or beans to build a civilization on. p133

it's not about one species. you need enough domesticatable stuff around that hunter gatherers evolve to become sedentary. wild apples exist in north america, but it's not enough. p134

Mediterranean climate select for human-friendly crops. p136

wheat and barley require minimal domestication, self-pollinate. corn required extensive domestication. p137

comparison of fertile crescent to other mediterranean zones. p139

list of important domesticable plants and animals in the fertile crescent, america (turkey, dog, corn). p142

fertile crescent started domestication after 9000bc, entirely sedentary by 6000bce. mesoamerica started by 3500bc (very uncertain) but no settled villages until 1500bc. p142

evidence that hunter gatherers were very familiar with many useful plant species. p145

modern systematic evaluation of wild grasses. nothing else as good. p146

New Guinea. anatomically modern people have been there 40k years. longer than americas, western europe. plenty of time to become familiar with plants. not very productive wild plants for hunting and gathering, so pressure to switch to food production. but no cereals or beans, minimal game. protein deficiency. also: they readily adopted sweet potatoes when exposed centuries ago. population boom. plenty willing to give good things a chance. p147-150

protein content of rice, wheat, etc. p149

eastern usa also limited by available plants. corn beans squash around 900ad. triggered population boom. p151-2

modern plant breeders got pecans and blueberries, but native americans did not overlook staples. p152

chapter about which animals are suited for domestication. p157

american large animals extinct around 13,000 years ago. p162

disease prevented the spread of horses through more of africa. p164

Same few species of animals were domesticated repeatedly (dna analysis). p166

table of when animals were domesticated. sheep, goats, pigs 10k years ago. cows 9k years ago. p167


Significant modern effort to domesticate other large animals. eland (big african antelope) would be particularly valuable since it's resistant to african diseases. not much success. p168

conditions for domesticatability. p169
- diet. mostly disqualifies carnivores
- growth rate
- difficult to breed in captivity
- nasty disposition. grizzly bear mostly eats plants, 1700 lbs, grows fast. but suicidal to keep. hippos too
- tendency to panic. batter themselves against the cage
- social structure. submissive to a leader, comfortable around others, ok sharing territory

spread of crops and livestock also allowed picking up new things. p177

food production never reached california, despite good climate. also never spread from pacific islands to australia. p178

domestic animals from andes never spread to mesoamerica. p178

crops in america (beans, peppers, squash) were all domesticated repeatedly. asian crops were domesticated once and spread. spread was fast enough to preclude re-domestication. p179

crops all over europe by 7000 years ago. a bit later for the british isles. p181

plants are adapted by latitude. length of day, temperature, rainfall, disease. p184

unclear if food production arose independently in sahel or if it was triggered by arrival of fertile crescent crops. p186

cattle, sheep, goats failed to make it to south africa (mediterranean climate) due to diease near the equator. p186

highland mexico would have matches andes climate, but most crops and animals never made it. corn did eventually. potatoes, llamas, guinea pigs never did. p187

similarly, turkeys and sunflowers would have been good for the andes, but were stuck in eastern usa.

corn adapted for colder temperature reached north america around 900ad. p187

corners of australia could not grow crops from pacific islands. waited for fertile crescent crops to arrive on boats. p188

NS axis also slowed crop spread into malaysia, between pakistan and india. p188

barrier in eurasia. indus valley (summer rainfall to winter rainfall). tibetan plateau. himalayas. overcome 4000 years ago when wheat, horses reached china. p189

big chunks of america are hostile to agriculture. central america, texas. p189

mesoamerican wheel, writing never reached the andes. wheel spread quickly east and west from fertile crescent. p190

societies that traded crops and livestock ended up trading technology also. p190

smallpox, flu, tuberculosis, malaria, plague, measles, cholera originally from animals. p196

explanation of epidemics. p202

epidemic diseases can't develop in hunter-gatherer societies. smallpox will burn out in a population less than about half a million. p203

hunter-gatherers move. farmers have to stay close to their own sewage. p205

food storage attracts rodents. p205

Table of diseases and similar version for animals. p207

Why did Aztecs and Incas not develop epidemic diseases? Minimal trade across long distances maybe a factor. Population centers arose much later. domesticated animals. p213

writing was created independently at least twice, maybe 4+ times. also a map. p218

development of writing system took hundreds or thousands of years. p224

alphabet arose only once. p226

Cherokee writing system by idea diffusion. inventor knew of the idea of writing but was not literate. p229

almost everyone was illiterate. just scribes. few enough to trace their individual handwriting (dozens) p234

purpose of the first writing was to "enslave other humans." bookkeeping by the powerful, propaganda. p235

first writing was carried out by full-time scribes. can't do that unless you have a food surplus to feed them. p236

many societies with food production never gained writing. incas. island empires. subequatorial africa before islam. note: invention of language super rare, mostly needs to spread by traffic. p237

individual geniuses are less important than you think for inventions. p245

invention happens iteratively. first iterations are for fun, since they're not good enough to be useful. p245

talking about why a society might accept or reject new things. p248

WWI launched lots of technology, but war can also set innovation back. p251

different sub-groups vary in receptiveness. the most receptive can gain an advantage. over a large time and area, there will be receptiveness to innovation. p253

technology in general (as shown for writing, food production) is easier to borrow than to reinvent from scratch. trade helps. p255

in the middle of europe, islam got its own inventions, plus inventions from india and china. p256

moving away from an invention can happen in isolation. Japan had lots of guns in 1600, then pretty much got rid of them. but if one country in europe had tried to move away from guns it would have been conquered by its neighbors. p258

metalworking. first, pure gold and copper out of the ground. soft enough to hammer without heat. then ovens for ceramics. then bronze (copper alloy). then iron. p259

VERY NICE. technology compounds on itself. example with the printing press. p259

inventions happen faster with lots of people, lots of competing subgroups. p261

americas chopped up. incas in the andes split off by isthmus of panama. dense forest, never urbanized. aztecs in the mexican highlands were split from north america by north mexico desert. west coast of USA also isolated by desert, mountains

terminology for the size of a society. table. p268

chimps and gorillas live in bands (dozens of individuals, nomadic). most humans did too 11,000 years ago. p270

"chiefdom" -- the chief is externally recognized, has a monopoly on force. p272

bigger societies have numerical advantage. probably also technological advantage. centralized political power is an advantage when moving troops. also nationalism and religion. p283

how do bands become tribes, how do chiefdoms become states? p284

food production is seasonal work, which means you also have seasonal availability for war, building pyramids, etc. p285

as a population becomes large, you have a growing risk of conflict between unrelated people. central authority is better than letting them murder each other. p286

polittical structure is necessary, one way or another, to make choices in a big population. p286

known example of chiefdoms consolidating into a state: cherokee confederacy. similarly, 13 colonies. consolidation of germany in 1871. p289

meltiing of ice sheets about 12k-8k years ago freed up water, raised sea levels. p297

comparing australia and new guinea.
torres strait. easily crossed by canoe. filled in 10k years ago
isolated genetically from south asia, mostly, for 30k+ years
NG has good soil, lots of rain. australia has no mountains or glaciers or volcanoes or rivers. poor soil.
linguistic analysis indicates minimal mixing with asian languages
p302

new guinea did develop food production, but had no good protein source. chickens and pigs eventually from asia. nothing big enough to pull a plow or cart. p306

NG population was about a million, but fragmented by geographical barriers. no writing, central political authority.

australia gad a smaller population than ng. 300k

australia. not much seasonal variation. lots of el nińo. bad for crops. bad native plants in australia. modern science has only given the macadamia. p309

australia was on the path to food production. domesticating or fermenting out the poison from seeds. eel canals. millet. p310

tasmania was originally joined to the mainland. split off when sea levels rose. very small population. technological regression: bone tools. p311

interactions between australia and NG went through small islands. not efficient for transferring technology. also very far from NG highlands to australian highlands. geographic barriers prevent technology from spreading. p317

testing this theory with australia and NG. interesting because of the islands becoming isolated about 10k years ago. can trace the spread and interaction of people via genetics and linguistics. p317

NG was exposed to germs via indonesia. people from western europe got clobbered by NG germs. people from indonesia didn't.

australia better for european crops and livestock.
