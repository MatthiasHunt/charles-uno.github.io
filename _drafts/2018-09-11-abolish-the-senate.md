The Senate never offered proportional representation. In 1790, the first census, one third of the population controlled almost two thirds of the Senate[^1]. Since then, it's become a bit worse; [by 2040](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-variedand-globalthreats-confronting-democracy-1511193763), 30% of the US population is expected to control 70% of the Senate. Unsurprisingly, such skewed representation was controversial from the start. At the Constitutional Convention, Hamilton called the Senate "[confessedly unjust](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/debcont.asp)." Madison spoke against it as well, but ultimately endorsed it as a "[lesser evil](https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-62)" -- without such a [compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise), smaller states may have refused to join the union.

[^1]: Two thirds of the population lived in six states. The other third was spread across ten (and so held 20/32 seats in the Senate).

Modern retellings tend to be a bit more poetic. Charles C W Cooke, editor of National Review, [writes](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/senate-hasnt-skewed-supreme-court-to-right/):

> Provided that federal power remains in check, the Senate prevents no state from enacting whichever policies it wishes to within its border; it merely prevents a handful of states from riding roughshod over their smaller counterparts on those few questions that are inherently national. Thus was the republic deliberately arranged.

At face value, Cooke's framing seems reasonable. It sounds a lot like the EU, where each state is largely autonomous, but interstate and international relations are facilitated by the union. But it does beg the question: over the past few centuries, which issues have prompted America's small states to throw their weight around in the Senate?

The answer is damning:

- During Jim Crow, local authorities would often turn a blind eye to the lynching of African Americans. The House passed a [bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyer_Anti-Lynching_Bill) to make lynching a federal crime, but it was filibustered to death in the Senate.
- In 1946, the House passed a bill abolishing the poll tax for federal elections. It was [halted in the Senate](https://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal46-1411331) via filibuster. Poll taxes continued to disenfranchise poor (especially Black) voters in the South until the [24th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), eighteen years later.
- Sen Thurmond spoke for over 24 hours straight to filibuster the [Civil Rights Act of 1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957). This is the longest filibuster in US history.
- Southern senators filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for two months. The filibuster was ultimately broken by weakening the bill.

*In the House, seat allocation (white) is roughly proportional with two-party[^2] vote share (red/blue), with swings at the extremes[^3]. It's very unusual for a minority of voters to control a majority of seats. In the Senate, seats swing wildly. The majority party in the Senate has been elected by a minority of voters about half the time since 1980.*

[^2]: Disproportionate representation is expected when one party is much more popular than the other. For example, if the national popular vote is 60% Republican to 40% Democrat, Democrats will only win districts with a [partisan lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index) of D+20 or more -- and districts like that are rare!

[^3]: Two-party vote share means votes for third-party candidates are ignored.


Notably, southern states could not resist the reconstruction amendments to the US constitution because rebel states were controlled by reconstruction governments from the end of the Civil War until 1877.

[Senate website](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Filibuster_Cloture.htm): "Filibusters were particularly useful to Southern senators who sought to block civil rights legislation"

Federal powers are far more expansive now than they were in the 18th century. Specifically, the federal government has since taken on an important role that the founders did not envision: defense of minority rights. The civil war and its aftermath were an unprecedented consolidation of federal power. Likewise, all civil rights legislation has infringed upon the rights of states to manage their internal affairs (especially elections).

Current Senate is disproportionate way beyond what the founders would have known. In 1790, the first census, the ratio between the biggest state and the smallest was nine-to-one (Virginia 450k, Delaware 50k). They might have expected states to break up. In the 18th century, borders were in flux within the US. Kentucky was formerly a piece of Virginia, and Vermont was split off of NH/NY. Even national borders weren't settled in the 18th century! Modern-day Germany was divided between Prussia, the Habsburgs, and a number of small states. Italy didn't exist yet. The Ottoman Empire covered Turkey and the Balkans.

[Wikipedia Connecticut Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise): "Madison argued that a conspiracy of large states against the small states was unrealistic as the large states were so different from each other."

There is value in a bicameral legislature, to divide representation along more than one axis.

To be a bit silly, imagine a chamber with 26 seats, one for each letter of the alphabet. You vote based on your initial. This would probably serve to elevate minority voices -- for example, Yang and Vang are common named among Asian Americans, but few European names start with those letters.

More practically, consider a chamber in which you vote for a seat based on your profession. There's a seat to represent plumbers, another for teachers, another for firefighters, another for programmers. It's likely that this chamber would offer a significantly different perspective from our existing Congress, which is dominated by lawyers.

In that sense, the Senate is fine -- but as a lower chamber. The lower chamber steers the upper and adds friction. Makes unified control of government more difficult, adds incentive to compromise, facilitates novel solutions. But the US Senate is the upper chamber, unambiguously more powerful than the House (in a parliamentary system, it's traditionally the other way around). SCOTUS is the most visible example, but also cabinet confirmations and the filibuster.

Basically no action on civil rights for a century. A few laws passed during reconstruction, but they were dismantled/undermined by state/local laws. Some were struck down by SCOTUS. Substance took a century. Brown v Board of Education (1954), Civil Rights Act (1964), Voting Rights Act (1965)

The fact that the Senate gives a disproportionate voice to southern whites is likely why important civil rights victories were dispensed by SCOTUS rather than being legislated. Brown v Board of Education, Loving v Virginia.

If we're going to give disproportionate representation to one group, why is it rural whites, who (1) are a big enough voting bloc to look out for themselves, and (2) have shitty priorities, specifically racism
