WOTC printed [[Scapeshift]] in 2008, [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut]] in 2009, and [[Primeval Titan]] in 2010. For eight years after that, they walked on eggshells to avoid further enabling land-based combo decks in Modern. As recently as 2018, fifty-six of the sixty cards in an [Amulet Titan main deck](https://www.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/articles/how-to-play-modern-amulet-titan-2nd-place-at-grand-prix-hartford/) were printed before the existence of Instagram[^1]. Design philosophy [finally changed](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/play-design-lessons-learned-2019-11-18) about a year ago, and WOTC seems to be making up for lost time. After eight years of drought, we got [[Arboreal Grazer]], [[Field of the Dead]], [[Castle Garenbrig]], [[Once Upon a Time]], and [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] all in the space of eight months.

[^1]: Instagram was launched in October 2010. Cards most commonly played alongside [[Primeval Titan]] in Modern include [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] (first printed in 2004), [[Sakura-Tribe Elder]] (2004), [[Farseek]] (2005), [[Simic Growth Chamber]] (2006), [[Search for Tomorrow]] (2006), [[Summoner's Pact]] (2007), [[Tolaria West]] (2007), [[Vesuva]] (2007), [[Prismatic Omen]] (2008), [[Explore]] (2009), [[Oracle of Mul Daya]] (2009), [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut]] (2009), [[Amulet of Vigor]] (February 2010), and [[Ancient Stirrings]] (April 2010).

One new card is exciting. Two is even better. But five new cards in quick succession can be overwhelming, especially for a synergy-driven deck like Amulet Titan. [[Field of the Dead:FOTD]] wants us to have more lands on the table, but half the point of bounce lands is that we can get to six mana with *fewer* lands. [[Castle Garenbrig]] works best when we play [[Breeding Pool]] over [[Gemstone Mine]], but that makes it harder to splash off-color sideboard cards. [[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]] took the place of colorless tools like [[Walking Ballista]], but without those tools it's not clear if [[Ancient Stirrings]] is worthwhile. Finding a balance between so many competing incentives takes hours upon hours of playtesting -- more time than we have to spare!

## Model

That's where the computer comes in. My numerical model[^2] can read in a deck list, [goldfish](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Goldfishing) thousands of games, and tell us exactly how reliably that list can expect to cast [[Primeval Titan]] by turn three. Using the model, it's possible to compare competing cards one-on-one (like [[Arboreal Grazer]] and [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]]) as well as measure the effect of card combinations that are more than the sum of their parts, like [[Castle Garenbrig]] and [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]][^5].

[^2]: The code (written in Python) is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/charles-uno/mtg-model). Pull requests welcome!

[^5]: In the face of removal, [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] only jumps us from three mana to five. [[Castle Garenbrig]] bridges the gap from five to six for [[Primeval Titan]]. [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove:Dryad]] also makes all our lands Forests to ensure that [[Castle Garenbrig:Castle]] enters untapped.

The model doesn't know anything about sequencing or strategy. Instead, it tries all possible combinations of legal plays. This approach is computationally inefficient, but it's guaranteed to find the fastest way to win, even when faced with nontrivial choices. For example, let's say we cast [[Once Upon a Time]] and see [[Forest]], [[Primeval Titan]], [[Simic Growth Chamber]], and two noncreature spells. An experienced player can generally eyeball the correct choice, but spelling out the decision explicitly for the computer is tedious and error-prone -- a calculation based on whether we have an [[Amulet of Vigor]], how many green sources, and so on. Instead of all that, the model just makes three copies of the game. The first copy takes [[Forest]], the second takes [[Primeval Titan]], and the third takes [[Simic Growth Chamber]], then they each proceed independently from there. If any copy finds a line to get [[Primeval Titan]] on the table by turn three, it's pretty safe to say a human player could have done the same.

![Example Output](/assets/images/mtg-model-amulet-t3.png)
*The model thinks it has to sacrifice [[Castle Garenbrig]] to use the second ability. This makes some bookkeeping easier under the hood. There's no effect on the outcome, since the simulation ends as soon as we cast [[Primeval Titan]].*

The downside of brute force is that the computer essentially has superhuman "instincts" about the order of the deck. When a human player casts [[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]], they have to commit to a choice without knowing what their next card will be. The computer tries all options and keeps whichever works out best. Several corrections[^3] are included in the model to suppress non-human play patterns, but even so, numbers generated by the model include a percent-level bias due to [[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]].

[^3]: To suppress non-human play patterns, the order of the deck is locked in as soon as the game begins. There are no mulligans. And any time the computer would search its deck for a card, instead it leaves the deck as-is and creates a new copy of that card out of thin air. This means no deck thinning, which introduces a small uncertainty (well under 1%).

## Questions

For the sake of brevity, we're not getting into the numbers for [[Once Upon a Time]] and [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]]. Both cards are so obviously powerful that they saw near-universal adoption as soon as they were available[^4]. Instead, we're looking at three questions that (according to [decklist aggregators](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/metagame/modern#paper)) remain unresolved:

[^4]: For a rundown of how [[Once Upon a Time]] and [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] shook up Amulet Titan, check out [this piece](http://magic.facetofacegames.com/how-theros-broke-amulet-titan/) by Daryl Ayers.

- [[Arboreal Grazer]] vs [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]]. [[Arboreal Grazer:Grazer]] ramps immediately, typically setting up three mana on turn two. On the other hand, [[Sakura-Tribe Scout:Scout]] can be activated multiple times. Which makes us more likely to cast [[Primeval Titan]] by turn three?
- [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking]] vs [[Explore]]. Before [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]], the deck generally played [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] alongside [[Explore]]. [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove:Dryad]] is too powerful not to play -- but which is it replacing?
- [[Castle Garenbrig]] vs [[Gruul Turf:Previous]] [[Gemstone Mine:Lands]]. Our most explosive draws involve an untapped land on turn one, followed by a bounce land. Are we really coming out ahead if we cut untapped lands and bounce lands to make room for [[Castle Garenbrig:Castle]]?

Simulations make use of the list below. The letter `X` represents [[Arboreal Grazer]] or [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]], `Y` is [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] or [[Explore]], and `Z` is either four [[Castle Garenbrig]] or two [[Gemstone Mine]] and two more [[Selesnya Sanctuary:bounce]] [[Gruul Turf:lands]].

Note that the above list does not include [[Cavern of Souls]] or [[Vesuva]] due to complexity. We're also not accounting for small variations between deck lists. Some people play [[Boros Garrison]], [[Crumbling Vestige]], a third [[Tolaria West]], and so on. Wiggle room in the mana base introduces a potential percent-level bias across the board, but should not affect our ability to make relative comparisons.

## Numbers

A year ago, we might have looked at the odds of casting [[Primeval Titan]] by turn four. [[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]] improves the deck's speed and consistency to a point where that's no longer interesting. The table below focuses on turn three. Turn two, rarely seen since [ancient times](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-18-2016-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2016-01-18), is again within reach as well.

| X      | Y       | Z         | Turn 2 | Turn 3 | Turn 3 vs Removal |
|:------:|:-------:|:---------:|:------:|:------:|:-----------------:|
| Grazer | Azusa   | Castle    | 4%     | 34%    | 32%               |
| Grazer | Azusa   | No Castle | 5%     | 34%    | 29%               |
| Grazer | Explore | Castle    | 4%     | 38%    | 32%               |
| Grazer | Explore | No Castle | 5%     | 33%    | 28%               |
| Scout  | Azusa   | Castle    | 2%     | 35%    | 18%               |
| Scout  | Azusa   | No Castle | 3%     | 33%    | 15%               |
| Scout  | Explore | Castle    | 2%     | 36%    | 15%               |
| Scout  | Explore | No Castle | 2%     | 35%    | 10%               |

<p class="table-caption">Statistical uncertainty ±1% for all values. That means the difference between 33% and 34% is not significant, and the difference between 33% and 35% toes the line.</p>

Above, columns `X`, `Y`, and `Z` show the different configurations of the deck, per the previous section. For each configuration, the value under `Turn 2` is the percent of seven-card hands that can cast [[Primeval Titan]] on turn two. Similarly, the `Turn 3` column shows the percent of seven-card hands that can cast [[Primeval Titan]] by turn three. Values for `Turn 2` and `Turn 3` assume a non-interactive opponent. The final column, `Turn 3 vs Removal`, assumes the opposite. For that case, the calculation is repeated assuming our opponent *always* has removal for our creatures, so we never get to untap with [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]], [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove:Dryad]], or [[Sakura-Tribe Scout:Scout]]. This is particularly relevant when considering [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove:Dryad]] as a potential replacement for [[Azusa, Lost but Seeeking:Azusa]]. [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] ramps us from three mana to six on her own, even if she eats a [[Fatal Push]]. [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove:Dryad]] only gets us to five.

## Conclusions and Caveats

Let's start easy: [[Castle Garenbrig]] is a slam dunk. By cutting untapped lands and bounce lands, we know we're hurting our chances of casting [[Primeval Titan]] on turn two. It turns out the damage is minimal. And on turn three, [[Castle Garenbrig:Castle]] gives a significant boost. Playing fewer bounce lands also makes the deck less vulnerable to [[Assassin's Trophy]], [[Damping Sphere]], and [[Field of Ruin]]. It's almost as if [[Castle Garenbrig]] was designed specifically to be played with [[Primeval Titan]].

Numbers look strong for [[Arboreal Grazer]] as well. It doubles our odds of casting [[Primeval Titan]] on turn two, then performs on par with [[Sakura-Tribe Scout:Scout]] on turn three against a non-interactive opponent. Throw a few [[Lava Dart:Lava Darts]] into the mix, and [[Arboreal Grazer:Grazer]] is faster across the board. That all said, [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]] provides value as the game goes on. It lets us deploy [[Bojuka Bog]] in response to [[Past in Flames]], or a bounce land to defend against land destruction. The model can't tell us what that ability is worth.

Our last comparison is [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] versus [[Explore]], and it's not looking good for our favorite Monk. [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]]'s selling point is explosive acceleration in the first few turns of the game. But, unless we're playing [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]] against a stack of [[Lightning Bolt:Lightning Bolts]], [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] goldfishes no better than [[Explore]]. And in a long game, drawing a card with [[Explore]] is much better than paying three mana for a [[Squire]].

[[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]]'s lackluster performance is initially surprising, but makes sense once we consider the bigger picture. Her job is to jump us from three mana to six, even in the face of removal, and even if we have no other acceleration. A year ago, that's exactly what we wanted.

But in combination with [[Castle Garenbrig]] and [[Once Upon a Time]], it's overkill.

Amulet Titan today plays more acceleration than ever before, plus a free cantrip to reliably access it.

The lackluster performances by [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] and [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]] are initially surprising, since the cards are individually powerful.

Turn-one [[Sakura-Tribe Scout:Scout]] delivers turn-four [[Primeval Titan]] on her own, or turn three with an [[Amulet of Vigor:Amulet]]. [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] jumps us from three mana to six, even in the face of removal.

Meanwhile [[Arboreal Grazer]] and [[Explore]] only deliver one extra land each.

Grazer can give us three mana on turn two. Can also new mana on the turn it's cast when combined with Amulet and a boune land.
A year ago, that's exactly what we wanted.

But between [[Castle Garenbrig]] and [[Once Upon a Time]], lists today are playing more acceleration than ever before -- so it's more important than ever before that our acceleration fits together nicely.


Having three mana on turn two is important, and STS doesn't reliably provide it

Explore is cheaper than Azusa, and draws a card



But [[Castle Garenbrig]] and [[Once Upon a Time]] have fundamentally changed how the deck works.


But in combination with [[Castle Garenbrig]] and [[Once Upon a Time]], it's overkill.

Amulet Titan today plays more acceleration than ever before, plus a free cantrip to reliably access it.







The model knows how to transmute [[Tolaria West]], as well as how to play it as a land. It knows how to float mana and stack triggers when it has [[Simic Growth Chamber]] and multiple [[Amulet of Vigor:Amulets]]. It even knows how to [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]] for [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] on turn two, play its extra lands, then pay for the [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]] on turn three. Basically, it can figure out the same line a human player would, but faster. My laptop can simulate a game in a few seconds. Running overnight, it can simulate thousands.

Other than power level concerns, these changes are good! Get some of the weird stuff out of there. Shorten turns. Less mana floating, less shuffling, fewer extra land drops to keep track of. Feels more direct, less masturbatory

Synergy is complicated!

- OUAT displaces Karn/Trinket/Golos/EE/etc. Makes Stirrings worse. Stirrings ultimately gets cut
- Without [[Ancient Stirrings]], the deck is less likely to have [[Amulet of Vigor]]. Makes you want a higher land count to cast Titan the "fair" way.
- Castle displaces some number of bounce lands, making Amulet and Scout worse. Also makes us want to play more Forests. Cut Gemstone Mine for Breeding Pool.
- Field of the Dead and Valakut allow you to shave on Tolaria West
- Off-color bounce lands like [[Boros Garrison]] are awkward since Castle makes Titan cost 2GGG
- Hanweir Battlements doesn't give a power boost or vigilance, but you can pay for it with Valakut
- Castle also ramps by itself, making the double-ramp from Azusa less important. Dryad is almost as good.
- Dryad makes you want to have 3 mana on turn 2, which makes Grazer look better than Scout.
- Valakut lets the deck go over the top without double strike

Cards printed in 2019 were off the charts in terms of power level. 

Hogaak dominated Modern for months, even after the banning of Bridge from Below.

Oko has been banned from every format that doesn't allow dual lands.

WAR saw two cards restricted in Vintage; only two other sets in the Modern era share this dubious honor. Mental Misstep and Gitaxian Probe (NPH), Treasure Cruise and Dig Through Time (KTK)

Of the nine cards currently banned from Pioneer (which goes back to 2014), five were printed in 2019.
Not counting fetch lands. They were excluded to cut down on shuffling, rather than banned for power level.
