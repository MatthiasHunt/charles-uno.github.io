Note that this is a **ROUGH** draft, copy-pasted from an **OLD** sketch. It's entirely possible that it includes things that are wrong/problematic.

I love talking about political issues

Much more interesting to talk with someone who doesn't agree.

Often, the interesting thing is not where we disagree, but *why*.

This is an attempt to assemble a list of axioms from which my specific policy positions cann be derived.

It's not yet clear if/where some issues fit:

- Marriage, charities, small businesses, etc... it's the government's role to support and encourage beneficial institutions?
- Research. Maybe this is a beneficial institution. Maybe this is related to the fact that government-run industries don't experience market forces, and so aren't necessarily pushed to innovate.
- It is not the role of the government to assess the sincerity of an individual's convictions. either make something legal, or make it illegal. no exceptions because they feel like it, and definitely no financial incentives to have belief.
- Private property is a right. is this necessary, or implied by the naturally-emergent market?

Intro intro intro

Let's start with three key definitions:

**People are sentient beings; as such, their well-being is innately valuable.**

Due to our limited understanding of sentience, this definition carries some ambiguity: are people in a vegetative state sentient? Are apes or dolphins? How about supercomputers? For the moment, it'll suffice to say that humans are sentient, starting some time after [24 weeks gestation](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-does-consciousness-arise/).

vulnerable persons. the disabled. children. it's not a problem to force your kid to eat vegetables, even though you are coercing them, violating self determination. it is a problem to prevent your kid from going to school (for example if you think that women belong in the home, and so don't need to know how to read).

Note that we're also punting on the distinction between citizens, permanent residents, refugees, and so on (not to mention people who live in other countries). That discussion falls under the purview of the as-yet unwritten third section of this document.

**The capitalist market is a system by which people exchange goods and services. Given a sufficient population size, it seems to be naturally-occurring.**

The market encourages efficiency and innovation through private ownership and competition. The market is amoral. Sometimes "innovation" means the development of electricity; sometimes it means the development of the transatlantic slave trade.

**The government is a system of law and enforcement, of taxation and redistribution.**

It is built by the people, of the people, for the people. The government is a formalized social contract; it's important because people are social creatures -- we evolved to work together -- but our population growth has long since outstripped our ability for empathy. Even for a compassionate person, it's easy to ignore the suffering of a stranger.

Now, on to the axioms themselves:

# I. It is the role of the government to protect the rights of the people.

- Self determination is a right.
    - It is not the government's role to restrict what consenting adults do with their bodies. The law must not infringe upon a person's freedom of speech, expression of religion, recreational substance use, sexual habits, etc, except to protect the rights of others.
    - It is the government's role to defend people from violence, coercion, detention, traumatic stress, and gross negligence. To this end, it is the role of the government to establish emergency response systems, such as police and fire departments. The government may limit a person's rights (for example, through incarceration) if that person poses an immediate threat to the rights of others.
    - Suspected criminals have the right to a prompt, fair trial. Convicted criminals have the right to rehabilitation. While punishment may serve as a deterrent to minor crimes (speeding tickets, etc), serious crimes are typically a symptom of poverty, addiction, or mental illness. Punishment in these cases does nothing to help the criminal rejoin society -- making them likely to commit another crime.
- Market access is a right.
    - Food, healthcare, housing, and education are rights. The lack of any one of these things poses a significant barrier to someone trying to enter (or re-enter) the workforce. Individuals, families, and the economy as a whole suffer when millions of people are willing to work, but prevented from doing so by personal crises. Note that these baseline needs should be satisfied unconditionally -- attaching a work requirement to government assistance artificially drives down the cost of labor, which poses an additional barrier to those working to escape poverty.
    - Workers have a right to reasonable compensation. Per above, the government must guarantee a livable baseline to each person. Any employment must compensate a worker sufficiently to raise their standard of living above that baseline. This means not only a living wage, but also time off (for example, evenings and weekends), guaranteed leave (such as for medical emergencies), and workplace safety measures (such as safety goggles and proper ventilation).
    - Discrimination in serving, hiring, pay, schooling, lending, and housing are violations of this right. Throughout history, markets have shown a willingness to tolerate discrimination; this has resulted in a significant, lasting harm to millions of people. The government is uniquely suited to address this systemic issue. Practices which discriminate based on race, faith, sexual orientation, gender identity, politics, marital status, intent to organize, etc must be met with strict scrutiny.
- Elected representation is a right.
    - People have the right to vote. The government must make a reasonable effort to enable every adult to vote, for example through early voting, voting by mail, or online voting. Any restriction on the right to vote (such as poll taxes, identification requirements, or barring felons from voting) must be met with strict scrutiny.
    - Voters have the right to proportional representation. Gerrymandering is a symptom of a flawed system: first-past-the-post districts. The state (the country?) should put all of the votes together, then assign representatives in proportion. For presidential elections, approval voting is probably best?
    - People have a right to a system of checks and balances. This keeps the tyranny of the majority in check. It also keeps the country stable, by preventing things from changing too fast.

# II. It is the role of the government to ensure that the market serves the people.

- The government protects the stability of the market
    - The government protects private ownership of property; it also provides a stable currency to enable that exchange of that property. Note that this includes both tangible (houses, cars) and intangible (patents, copyrights) property. Capitalism doesn't work unless people can own things. It also doesn't work if that ownership can be reliably circumvented through theft or coercion.
    - The government breaks up companies that become too large. This includes monopolies as well as too-big-to-fail banks. Once an organization becomes too large to care about market forces, it has to be reigned in.
    - It is the role of the government to redistribute wealth outside of the market. Capitalism is fueled by wealth inequality: if wealth is distributed evenly, social mobility vanishes as an incentive to work. However, if wealth inequality becomes too great, the system breaks down. When those at the bottom can't afford food and housing, they become unemployable. To prevent this from happening, the government must redistribute wealth downward, such as through food assistance and public education.
- The government injects morality into the market.
    - It is the role of the government to prevent the exploitation of workers. Throughout history and around the world, the market has demonstrated a willingness to tolerate the abuse of laborers, up to and including enslavement. The government must enforce each employer's obligation to respect the rights of their workers.
    - It is the role of the government to prevent the exploitation of consumers. Specialization is inevitable in a technological society. It is not reasonable to expect consumers to understand everything they buy, or to have the resources to test those products for safety. For example, few people can assess for themselves the safety of cell phone radiation levels, credit card encryption, food preservatives, etc. This role extends not only over products, but also over how they are presented. It falls under the purview of the government to ensure that cigarettes are not marketed to children, that sugar pills are not sold as medicine, and so on.
    - It is the role of the government to prevent the exploitation of the environment. A capitalist market can grow explosively when costs are pushed into the future, or inflicted upon a third party. Examples include the overfishing of tuna, earthquakes caused by hydraulic fracking, and climate change caused by consumption of fossil fuels. For the sake of safety and sustainability, the government must stabilize these markets, typically through regulation and/or taxation.
- The government absorbs parts of the market where the people are ill-served by capitalism.
    - Under capitalism, success drives growth, but some industries should not grow. For example, the people are ill-served by a private prison industry. Privately-owned prisons are lucrative, which creates an economic incentive to imprison more people. Note that the prison population in the United States increased dramatically after prisons were privatized, and the prison lobby is a strong opponent of marijuana decriminalization (since many prisoners are nonviolent drug users).
    - Under capitalism, competition creates efficiency, but sometimes competition is more costly than inefficiency. For example, the people are ill-served by a private garbage collection industry. Garbage trucks are the leading cause of damage to residential streets. A competitive market drives down the cost of garbage collection, but those savings are eclipsed by the cost of additional road repair.
    - Under capitalism, goods are available to anyone who can pay, but some goods should be available even to those who cannot pay. For example, the people are ill-served by a private water industry. It makes no fiscal sense to build and maintain expensive infrastructure in poor areas. The government can absorb that cost -- and must, in order to guarantee people their rights.

# III. It is the role of the government to interface with other governments.

- Immigration
- citizen / permanent resident / refugee / tourist
- The UN
- NATO
- Foreign aid
- War
- Trade agreements
