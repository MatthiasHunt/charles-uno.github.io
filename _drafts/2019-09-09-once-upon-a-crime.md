When Mark Rosewater [previewed](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/eldraine-or-shine-2019-09-09) [[Once Upon a Time]], eyebrows went up. Free stuff and efficient cantrips both have a history of ending up on the Modern banned list. This one in particular looks a lot like [[Ancient Stirrings]], a card which [was recently acknowledged](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-21-2019-banned-and-restricted-announcement) as potentially bannable.

Since then, I've simulated[^1] tens of thousands of opening hands over a handful of different archetypes. The numbers are pretty clear: [[Once Upon a Time]] is *very* powerful. If it doesn't get banned, it'll be a format staple.

## Tron

I'm no expert on Tron, but I believe (Pro Tour Chamption) Andrew Elenbogen when he says that [assembling Tron is the biggest bottleneck](https://twitter.com/Ajelenbogen/status/1171268444781760514). [[Once Upon a Time]] gives the deck a significant boost in that department. 


<table class="cardlist">
    <caption class="deckname">Tron</caption>
    <tr>

            4 [[Ancient Stirrings]]<br>
            4 [[Chromatic Sphere]]<br>
            4 [[Chromatic Star]]<br>
            4 [[Expedition Map]]<br>
            4 [[Sylvan Scrying]]<br>
            21 [[Karn Liberated]] or whatever
        </td>
        <td>
            4 [[Forest]]<br>
            4 [[Urza's Mine]]<br>
            4 [[Urza's Power Plant]]<br>
            4 [[Urza's Tower]]<br>
            3 [[Wastes]]<br>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>




Tron plays twenty tools to help assemble [[Urza's Mine]], [[Urza's Power Plant]], and [[Urza's Tower]]. 



Your average Tron list plays 19 lands alongside full sets of [[Ancient Stirrings]], [[Chromatic Star]], [[Chromatic Sphere]], [[Expedition Map]], and [[Sylvan Scrying]]. 



## Neobrand



## Amulet Titan


## Valakut



















the concern is justified. 

[[Once Upon a Time]] is an unfair card. 




basically the same numbers if you play it in addition to scrying, stirrings


in tron, it isn't competing with Stirrings. It's competing with Scrying.
