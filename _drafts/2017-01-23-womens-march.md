The day after Trump was sworn in as president, [Women's March](https://www.womensmarch.com/) protests drew an estimated 3.2M people -- [ten times as many](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-long-march-ahead-for-democrats/) as the Tea Party protests that followed Obama's inauguration in 2009. I attended the march at the Minnesota Capitol, which drew about 100k people, and came away conflicted.

The invited [speakers](https://www.womensmarchmn.com/rally) -- including Rep Betty McCollum, Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, and State Rep Ilhan Omar -- struck a forward-looking tone. They drummed up support for healthcare access, racial justice, LGBT rights, and female representation in government. Several speakers echoed Hillary's iconic line from Beijing, "women's rights are human rights." References to Trump were infrequent, and while he was always the opponent, speakers avoided sensationalist labels like "enemy," "evil," "fascist," and "Nazi."

By and large, the [speakers](https://www.womensmarchmn.com/rally) were excellent. Rep Betty McCollum, Lt Gov Tina Smith, and Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges drummed up support for healthcare access, racial justice, and LGBT rights. State Rep Ilhan Omar (noted for being the nation's first Somali-American legislator) leveraged her personal story into a powerful, forward-looking pledge to improve female representation in government. Several speakers echoed Hillary's iconic line from Beijing, "women's rights are human rights." References to Trump were infrequent. And while he was always the opponent, speeches avoided sensationalist labels like "enemy," "evil," "fascist," and "Nazi."

In contrast, the crowd's signs struck a reactionary tone: jabs at Trump's hands and hair, images of Trump with a Hitler-style mustache, and "this pussy grabs back." For every poster about unity or progress, there was another fixated on opposition. I was particularly struck by "Not My President" -- the same slogan [used by the Tea Party](http://www.cafepress.com/rightwingstuff/6166025) against Obama.

The rift between speakers and signholders was reminiscent of the 2016 Democratic primaries. The speakers showed an optimistic view of democracy: two steps forward, one step back. They were focused on building a broad coalition, due to their belief that people are [Stronger Together](http://www.npr.org/2016/08/08/489138602/trump-comment-gives-clinton-a-campaign-slogan-with-layered-meaning). The signholders were comparably new to the political scene; they were mostly young, mostly white, and mostly angry. And they seemed eager to tear down the system in a [Political Revolution](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/25/bernie-sanders-started-a-political-revolution-now-he-cant-stop-it/?utm_term=.9314035ede9a).

The speakers had been at this for a while. They had faith in the democratic system -- two steps forward, one step back. They had spent a lot of time building coalitions behind their policy proposals, due to their belief that we are [Stronger Together](http://www.npr.org/2016/08/08/489138602/trump-comment-gives-clinton-a-campaign-slogan-with-layered-meaning).

The signholders were comparatively new to the political scene. They were mostly young, mostly white, and mostly angry. And they were ready to burn the system down in a [Political Revolution](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/25/bernie-sanders-started-a-political-revolution-now-he-cant-stop-it/?utm_term=.9314035ede9a), and start again from scratch.

My initial response was to recoil from the signholders. I don't want to see [ideological purity tests](http://time.com/4205149/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-progressive/) to push out establishment Democrats in favor of know-nothing blowhards -- those same tactics hollowed out the leadership of the Republican party, making room for Trump in the first place. I don't want to see organizers concentrate their focus on white millenials, taking [captured](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-voters-are-so-loyal-that-their-issues-get-ignored/) voting blocs for granted.

But maybe I'm wrong. In the era of social media, maybe cynicism beats optimism. Maybe the left is losing because it's bringing 20th-century strategies to 21st-century elections.

Look at the past eight years. Obama was charismatic. He presided over a [strong economy](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-jobs-recovery-may-not-be-flashy-but-its-strong/). He ended the unpopular [Iraq war](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/subjects/iraq/). His administration was not involved in any major scandals. And yet Republicans were able to leverage anti-Obama rhetoric into massive electoral gains -- they control both houses of Congress, [trifectas](https://ballotpedia.org/Gubernatorial_and_legislative_party_control_of_state_government) in 25 states (compared to 4 for the Democrats), the presidency, and a [bonus SCOTUS seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland_Supreme_Court_nomination) to boot. Such Republican dominance hasn't been seen [since the Civil War](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/18/republicans-build-on-their-dominance-in-state-legislatures.html) era.

Tea party is intellectually bankrupt. Anti-intellectual. No platform -- just opposition. Willing to burn it all to the ground to deny the president victories.

I'm concerned that the Democratic Party is about to be faced with an insurgency of hard-liners -- much like the one that hollowed out the Republican establishment and paved the way for Trump in the first place. Rumblings of just such an insurgency were visible in the Democratic primaries when Bernie accused Hillary and other Democrats of not being "[true progressives](http://time.com/4205149/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-progressive/)[^1]."

[^1]: According to an analysis of her public statements, Senate voting record, and fundraising sources, FiveThirtyEight and OnTheIssues rate Hillary a "[hard core liberal](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/)," slightly to the left of Obama and significantly to the left of her husband.

the strength of a coalition comes from its size, not its homogeneity.

Ideological purity tests are how you build a small tent full of extremists -- who obstruct when they're in the minority and steamroll when they're in the majority.

I'd much rather have a big tent centered around broad, forward-looking goals: healthcare access, racial justice, livable wages, etc. If that means supporting pro-gun progressives in SD, or pro-pharma progressives in NJ, so be it. I don't need to agree with everyone about everything.

[Sanders suggested that Clinton was not a real progressive.](http://time.com/4205149/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-progressive/)

[Rep Barney Frank wrote in 1991:](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vqJJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Xg0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=4293,3641940&hl=en)

> His holier-than-thou attitude -- saying in a very loud voice that he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else -- really undercuts his effectiveness.

> To him, anyone who disagrees with him is a crook; there are no honest disagreements with people. Bernie's view of the world is that the great majority of people agree with him on all the issues and the only reason he does not win is that the Congress is crooked.

If the Women's March was a rally for the Democratic Party, organizers were wrong to kick pro-life groups to the curb. Pro-life Democrats exist, and they deserve a spot under the tent. (If the DNC only supported across-the-board progressives, it would be unable to compete for Senate seats in conservative states.)

On the other hand, if the Women's March was about rallying support for reproductive rights, including the right to abortion, the prominent inclusion of pro-life groups would muddle the message. Recall Occupy Wall Street: protests can't be powerful unless they're coherent.

The official website frames the march in terms of issues, not partisanship, and lists "open access to safe, legal, affordable abortion and birth control" as a core principle.

But that framing should perhaps be taken with a grain of salt -- the event's headliners were Democratic officials, 80% of its participation was in Obama/Clinton states, and


[Sen Booker says](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pol-womens-march-live-cory-booker-women-s-march-is-not-a-1485028604-htmlstory.html) "This is not a Democrat or Republican thing. This is actually something we can all unify around."

If opposition to Trump is (or appears) partisan, Trump wins in Congress. Rep Lewis's all-Democrat inauguration boycott presents the appearance of a unified GOP.

To erode Trump's 46%, it's important to showcase dissent within the GOP.

The march in DC [outnumbered](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/22/us/politics/womens-march-trump-crowd-estimates.html) the inauguration crowds the day before[^5].

[^5]: Comparing crowds in DC isn't quite fair, as Trump faces a home field disadvantage; he earned [only 4%](http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/district-of-columbia) of the vote there.
