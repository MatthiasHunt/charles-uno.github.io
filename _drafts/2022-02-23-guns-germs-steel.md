At the Massacre of Cajamarca, Pizarro and a few hundred Spaniards killed thousands of Incas and captured Emperor Atahualpa without suffering a single casualty.
Then they marched on the capital city of Cusco, killing thousands more Incan warriors along the way.
The Incan empire --- which at the time was [more populous than Spain][1500_populations] --- fell shortly thereafter.

[1500_populations]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_1500

The Spanish invasion was so successful, in part, because the conquistadors wore steel armor and rode horses.
They also carried (and were resistant to) deadly diseases such as smallpox.
Written language allowed Pizarro to model his tactics after the victories of Cort√©s.
And of course, Europe had the political structures to send expeditions around the world in the first place.
In his 1997 bestseller *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, Jared Diamond digs into human history (and prehistory) in order to explain why all these technologies[^1] developed in Eurasia[^2] but fewer or none of them developed on other continents.

[^1]: For lack of a better word, "technology" is used broadly here. It includes agriculture, livestock domestication, politics, written language, resistance to diseases, and more.

[^2]: The author uses "Eurasia" to refer jointly to Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The mediterranean coast of Africa is sometimes included as well. These regions have been linked by migration and trade for thousands of years.

Right off the bat, the author addresses the elephant in the room: it's not about race.
He emphatically rejects the idea that people in Eurasia were innately superior to those in Australia, the Americas, or Sub-Saharan Africa.
Instead, Diamond writes from the perspective of a biologist studying the human species overall.
The emphasis is not on individual people, or even groups, so much as the environments faced by early humans in different regions.

At the end of the last ice age (about 13,000 years ago) humans worldwide lived in nomadic hunter-gatherer societies.
Populations grew as the climate warmed.
Around that same time, mammoths and many other large animals [went extinct][extinction].
With more mouths to feed, and less game to hunt, humans became increasingly dependent on plants for food.
Cereals and legumes were particularly important.
Over thousands of years, humans in the Fertile Crescent domesticated wheat, barley, and peas.
Rice and soybeans were domesticated in China[^3] around that same time.

[^3]: The author devotes a lot of pages to the emergence of food production in the Fertile Crescent, including analysis of the climate and geography. Similar analysis is lacking for China, even though crops were domesticated there around the same time. It's possible that archeological evidence from China was more difficult to access in the 1990s. This is my biggest frustration with the book.

<span class="figure-caption">Wheat, barley, and peas were first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent about 10,000 years ago.</span>

The shift from hunter-gatherer society to sedentary food production was accidental, slow, and hungry.
Archeological records suggest that early food producers worked harder and died younger than hunter-gatherers.
But once food production was established, it snowballed.
Food production allowed rapid population growth and large population density.
Surplus food (and food storage) also freed up resources for specialized roles.
Food producers were the first human societies to have full-time artisans and bookkeepers --- as well as soldiers.
Neighboring hunter-gatherer societies were assimilated or displaced.
By about 8,000 years ago, Eurasia was covered with sedentary population centers built around food production.

Diamond argues that food production was critically important to the development of each technology listed up top.
Tracking and allocating bulk quantifies of food gave rise to writing and politics.
Wars between professional armies demanded new weapons and armor.
Close proximity to livestock was a vector for new diseases.
The author spends hundreds of pages tracing these causal chains in a way that's clear and engaging.



The author spends the second half of the book on this stuff, but in my mind it's important because it lets us zero in on the most interesting part of the book:



writing is clear and engaging
shows off an impressive breadth of research
but to me, it's an accessory to the best part of the book
the part where the author gets to really flex as a biologist




Finally zeroing in on (in my mind) the core question of the book:



why did food production arise in Eurasia 10,000 years ago, much later in the Americas and Sub-Saharan Africa, and not at all in Australia?





[^4]: Diamond spends the second half of his book fleshing out the causal change between food production and various technologies. Honestly, I skimmed some of it. In my mind, jump from hunter-gatherer society to sedentary food production is

Ancient peapods opened when ripe, dropping the seeds. A single mutation


The author spends about 100 pages on this topic.




animal domestication. diseases here too.

east-west continent. sahara, mexican desert

Agriculture developed elsewhere much later (Africa, America) or not at all (Australia).
this is 75 pages


Staple foods domesticated elsewhere, such as sorghum in Africa and corn in the Americas, did not appear until much more recently.
No grains or beans in Australia.

- Archeological evidence suggests that humans were familiar with native plant species.
- Recent efforts have domesticated many new fruits and vegetables, but no new staple foods.
- Corn was hard to domesticate. Millet far less productive.
- One crop isn't enough. Apples are native to the Americas, but you can't live on just apples.
- Transition from hunter-gatherer to food production is really hard!
- Animals. Only Eurasia has anything big enough to pull a plow. You can tame an elephant but it's still a dangerous wild animal.

Climate becomes more friendly to wild cereals, especially in mediterranean areas.

fertile crescent is the largest and most varied mediterranean biome on the planet. no surprise that the most (and best) grasses would evolve there.



linguistics? used to show the spread of populations






---


Incas were the "largest and most advanced state in the New World". p68

map of food production. p99
map of mediterraniean climates. p139

plant domestication in north america 6000 years later. 2500BC vs 8500BC. p100

middle east: wheat in 8500bc
china: rice by 7500bc
central america: corn by 3500bc
sahel: sorghum by 5000bc

linguistics. did farming spread or did farme*rs* spread. also skeletal structure

similar climates: south africa, mediterranean, california, sw australia

first farmers worked harder, were smaller, died younger than hunter gatherers

shifting from mostly wild food to mostly cultivated took thousands of years

8500bc vs 18500bs. wild game less abundant. wild cereals more abundant due to climate. technology for storage. density high enough to value calories per acre. p112

some areas suitable for food production but HGs never displaced due to geography. CA separated by desert from AZ. south africa with a different climate from tropical bantu crops. australia separated by sea from NG, indonesia. p113

wild almonds are bitter and toxic, but it's just one gene. early humans would find non-bitter ones by accident, interact preferrentially, propagate by accident then intentionally. p118

barley, wheat, peas, lentils, flax, poppies. natural seed dispersal threw seeds on the ground. single gene caused that to fail, making them much easier to harvest. accidental domestication since those are the ones that got propagated. p120

food production, rising density. chicken and egg. p111

table by crop type. cereal, bean, tuber. p126

plowing important for monoculture. p128

some species we failed to domesticate until recently. acorns, strawberries. p129

All staple foods were domesticated thousands of years ago. Some recent fruits and veggies but no grains or beans to build a civilization on. p133

it's not about one species. you need enough domesticatable stuff around that hunter gatherers evolve to become sedentary. wild apples exist in north america, but it's not enough. p134

Mediterranean climate select for human-friendly crops. p136

wheat and barley require minimal domestication, self-pollinate. corn required extensive domestication. p137

comparison of fertile crescent to other mediterranean zones. p139

list of important domesticable plants and animals in the fertile crescent, america (turkey, dog, corn). p142

fertile crescent started domestication after 9000bc, entirely sedentary by 6000bce. mesoamerica started by 3500bc (very uncertain) but no settled villages until 1500bc. p142

evidence that hunter gatherers were very familiar with many useful plant species. p145

modern systematic evaluation of wild grasses. nothing else as good. p146

New Guinea. anatomically modern people have been there 40k years. longer than americas, western europe. plenty of time to become familiar with plants. not very productive wild plants for hunting and gathering, so pressure to switch to food production. but no cereals or beans, minimal game. protein deficiency. also: they readily adopted sweet potatoes when exposed centuries ago. population boom. plenty willing to give good things a chance. p147-150

protein content of rice, wheat, etc. p149

eastern usa also limited by available plants. corn beans squash around 900ad. triggered population boom. p151-2

modern plant breeders got pecans and blueberries, but native americans did not overlook staples. p152

chapter about which animals are suited for domestication. p157

american large animals extinct around 13,000 years ago. p162

disease prevented the spread of horses through more of africa. p164

Same few species of animals were domesticated repeatedly (dna analysis). p166

Significant modern effort to domesticate other large animals. eland (big african antelope) would be particularly valuable since it's resistant to african diseases. not much success. p168

conditions for domesticatability. p169
- diet. mostly disqualifies carnivores
- growth rate
- difficult to breed in captivity
- nasty disposition. grizzly bear mostly eats plants, 1700 lbs, grows fast. but suicidal to keep. hippos too
- tendency to panic. batter themselves against the cage
- social structure. submissive to a leader, comfortable around others, ok sharing territory

spread of crops and livestock also allowed picking up new things. p177

food production never reached california, despite good climate. also never spread from pacific islands to australia. p178

domestic animals from andes never spread to mesoamerica. p178

crops in america (beans, peppers, squash) were all domesticated repeatedly. asian crops were domesticated once and spread. spread was fast enough to preclude re-domestication. p179

crops all over europe by 7000 years ago. a bit later for the british isles. p181

plants are adapted by latitude. length of day, temperature, rainfall, disease. p184

unclear if food production arose independently in sahel or if it was triggered by arrival of fertile crescent crops. p186

cattle, sheep, goats failed to make it to south africa (mediterranean climate) due to diease near the equator. p186

highland mexico would have matches andes climate, but most crops and animals never made it. corn did eventually. potatoes, llamas, guinea pigs never did. p187

similarly, turkeys and sunflowers would have been good for the andes, but were stuck in eastern usa.

corn adapted for colder temperature reached north america around 900ad. p187

corners of australia could not grow crops from pacific islands. waited for fertile crescent crops to arrive on boats. p188

NS axis also slowed crop spread into malaysia, between pakistan and india. p188

barrier in eurasia. indus valley (summer rainfall to winter rainfall). tibetan plateau. himalayas. overcome 4000 years ago when wheat, horses reached china. p189

big chunks of america are hostile to agriculture. central america, texas. p189

mesoamerican wheel, writing never reached the andes. wheel spread quickly east and west from fertile crescent. p190

societies that traded crops and livestock ended up trading technology also. p190

smallpox, flu, tuberculosis, malaria, plague, measles, cholera originally from animals. p196

explanation of epidemics. p202

epidemic diseases can't develop in hunter-gatherer societies. smallpox will burn out in a population less than about half a million. p203

hunter-gatherers move. farmers have to stay close to their own sewage. p205

food storage attracts rodents. p205

Table of diseases and similar version for animals. p207

Why did Aztecs and Incas not develop epidemic diseases? Minimal trade across long distances maybe a factor. Population centers arose much later. domesticated animals. p213

writing was created independently at least twice, maybe 4+ times. also a map. p218

development of writing system took hundreds or thousands of years. p224

alphabet arose only once. p226

Cherokee writing system by idea diffusion. inventor knew of the idea of writing but was not literate. p229

almost everyone was illiterate. just scribes. few enough to trace their individual handwriting (dozens) p234

purpose of the first writing was to "enslave other humans." bookkeeping by the powerful, propaganda. p235

first writing was carried out by full-time scribes. can't do that unless you have a food surplus to feed them. p236

many societies with food production never gained writing. incas. island empires. subequatorial africa before islam. note: invention of language super rare, mostly needs to spread by traffic. p237

individual geniuses are less important than you think for inventions. p245

invention happens iteratively. first iterations are for fun, since they're not good enough to be useful. p245

talking about why a society might accept or reject new things. p248

WWI launched lots of technology, but war can also set innovation back. p251

different sub-groups vary in receptiveness. the most receptive can gain an advantage. over a large time and area, there will be receptiveness to innovation. p253

technology in general (as shown for writing, food production) is easier to borrow than to reinvent from scratch. trade helps. p255

in the middle of europe, islam got its own inventions, plus inventions from india and china. p256

moving away from an invention can happen in isolation. Japan had lots of guns in 1600, then pretty much got rid of them. but if one country in europe had tried to move away from guns it would have been conquered by its neighbors. p258

metalworking. first, pure gold and copper out of the ground. soft enough to hammer without heat. then ovens for ceramics. then bronze (copper alloy). then iron. p259

VERY NICE. technology compounds on itself. example with the printing press. p259

inventions happen faster with lots of people, lots of competing subgroups. p261

americas chopped up. incas in the andes split off by isthmus of panama. dense forest, never urbanized. aztecs in the mexican highlands were split from north america by north mexico desert. west coast of USA also isolated by desert, mountains

terminology for the size of a society. table. p268

chimps and gorillas live in bands (dozens of individuals, nomadic). most humans did too 11,000 years ago. p270

"chiefdom" -- the chief is externally recognized, has a monopoly on force. p272

bigger societies have numerical advantage. probably also technological advantage. centralized political power is an advantage when moving troops. also nationalism and religion. p283

how do bands become tribes, how do chiefdoms become states? p284

food production is seasonal work, which means you also have seasonal availability for war, building pyramids, etc. p285

as a population becomes large, you have a growing risk of conflict between unrelated people. central authority is better than letting them murder each other. p286

polittical structure is necessary, one way or another, to make choices in a big population. p286

known example of chiefdoms consolidating into a state: cherokee confederacy. similarly, 13 colonies. consolidation of germany in 1871. p289
