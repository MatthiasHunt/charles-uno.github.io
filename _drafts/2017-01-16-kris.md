Everyone has fond memories of Risk. It's an iconic game. The board is well-designed. The little wooden blocks are satisfying to handle. 

The rules are a mess. 

High repetition in die rolls means the variance is actually pretty low. 

> The worst part of Risk is victory by excruciation. A well-designed game has tactics and skill building to a climax, a thrilling race to victory, and when someone has clearly won, it's because the game is over. In Risk, someone can win hours before it ends, and they will not let you just admit it and leave.
