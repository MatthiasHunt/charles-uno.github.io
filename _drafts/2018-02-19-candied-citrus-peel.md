I'm working from [Alton Brown's recipe](https://altonbrown.com/candied-orange-peel-recipe/), but with a few notes.

- 1 L (4 cups) water
- 500mL (2 cups) white sugar
- 4 ripe grapefruit

Alton uses oranges. Tangerines work too. But, of the fruit I've tried, grapefruit are best. He also recommends using a vegetable peeler to remove the citrus rind, but I've had better luck slicing the fruit then using a knife to "fillet" the peel from the flesh.
