Based on an analysis of all legal words in Wordle, the [best starting word][soare] is `SOARE`.
Or maybe, based on [information theory][crane], it's `CRANE`.
An [economist recommends][slice] `SLICE` if you want to minimize number of moves, or `ADEPT` if you want to minimize your odds to fail.
I personally start with `RATIO`, since I get the feeling that the author avoids[^1] the letter `E` to keep things interesting.
All these big-brain takes raise the question: how much does it really matter?

[^1]: The letter `E` appears in far more possible solutions than any other letter. However, four other letters (`I`, `N`, `O`, and `R`) appeared in more Wordles in January 2022. On top of that, there was only a single puzzle (`PERKY`) where `E` was the only vowel, while each other vowel appeared on its own repeatedly (for example, `U` was the only vowel in `WRUNG`, `SLUMP`, and `TRUSS`).

To investigate, I put together a computer simulation of Wordle (source code [here][source]).
The first guess can be specified.
Each subsequent guess is chosen randomly, taking into account all past clues.
Essentially, the computer plays in hard mode[^2] and always goes with the first compatible guess that pops into its head.
By applying that strategy to thousands upon thousands of puzzles, we can get a sense for the importance of a good opening word.

[^2]: From an informal survey, it seems like most people follow the rules of hard mode, whether or not they've flipped the toggle.

Before we get into the results, a quick disclaimer.
Wordle has two word lists.
There's a list of possible solutions (2,300 words) and a list of allowed guesses (12,900 words).
The vast majority of "real" words are in the solutions list, while the [non-solution words][non_solutions] are mostly nonsense like `KYLIX` and `UMIAQ`.
In the interest of imitating human play patterns, the model completely ignores the non-solution word list.

![Non-Solution Words Are Mostly Nonsense](/assets/images/wordle-nonsense-words.png)
*In the screenshot above, the computer was allowed to guess any legal word (instead of just possible solutions). The result is a bunch of nonsense words that humans don't actually use.*

I ran each of the starting words from above through 40,000 simulated puzzles.
Then I did the same with a variety of other starting words for comparison: `ADIEU` (lots of vowels), `LYMPH` (lots of consonants), `GEESE` (duplicate vowels), `FLUFF` (duplicate consonants), `MOIST` (funny), and `XYLYL` (possibly the [worst starting word][soare]).
Results are shown in the table below:

| First Guess | Win Rate (±0.5%) | Average Guesses (±0.02) |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-----------------------:|
| `ADEPT`     |         98.8%    |            3.92         |
| `ADIEU`     |         97.4%    |            4.02         |
| `CRANE`     |         98.5%    |            3.82         |
| `CRYPT`     |         98.9%    |            3.98         |
| `FLUFF`     |         97.4%    |            4.39         |
| `GEESE`     |         97.6%    |            4.21         |
| `GLYPH`     |         98.7%    |            4.09         |
| `LYMPH`     |         98.8%    |            4.10         |
| `MOIST`     |         98.7%    |            3.92         |
| `RATIO`     |         98.0%    |            3.91         |
| `SLICE`     |         98.8%    |            3.84         |
| `SOARE`     |         97.9%    |            3.88         |
| `XYLYL`     |         95.7%    |            4.50         |

Unsurprisingly, `XYLYL` is a terrible starting word.
`ADIEU` is about on par with random. Maybe worse. Turns out consonants matter. The solution probably has two vowels, so checking all four often gives redundant information.
`CRANE` and `SLICE` are the best in terms of converging fast. No statistically significant difference between them
`SOARE`, `RATIO`, `ADEPT` are all better than random, but visibly worse than the top two

put into perspective of... a month? a year? how many failures, how many extra guesses





Values are plus-or-minus about half a percent. That means the difference between 98.1% and 98.6% is not statistically significant.





This may skew my numbers one way or another overall[^3], but I see no reason it should affect relative comparisons between starting words.

[^3]: Using an optimal strategy, [The Economic Times][slice] says `SLICE` and `CRANE` should lead to a solution in 3.90 and 3.92 guesses respectively. My numbers are close to that, but my strategy is not optimal.




<!--
Based on our analysis, if you're trying to win in as few guesses as possible, the top three words to go with are "slice," "tried" and "crane." Using any of these three words will produce an average number of word attempts of 3.90, 3.92, and 3.92, respectively, if you're using an optimal strategy to play (more on that later).

If, on the other hand, you're simply trying to win within the allotted six guesses, the top three words to play are "adept," "clamp" and "plaid." Using any of these three words will yield an average success rate in winning the game of 98.79%, 98.75%, and 98.75%, respectively, if you're playing the optimal strategy.
