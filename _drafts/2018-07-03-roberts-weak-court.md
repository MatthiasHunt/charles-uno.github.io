Weak court is good. Bush v Gore is terrible. SCOTUS basically acted like a super-Senate and voted along party lines to stop the Florida recount and make GWB president.

Better to have a court that punts things back to the legislatures. That's who's actually elected to represent the people. That's who should be making choices.

Roberts seems to be a proponent of a weak court. He is known for writing wishy-washy opinions, and explicitly *not* setting precedent.

But you don't want the court to be infinitely weak. (If an infinitely weak court were ideal, we would just have no court at all.) SCOTUS needs to be strong enough to overrule the majority to defend the constitutional rights of the minority.

For example, Loving v Virginia or Brown v Board of Education.

Roberts has shown no particular interest in defending the civil rights of racial/ethnic minorities. He wrote the decision in Holder that struck down the enforcement mechanism in the VRA. He also punted on voter disenfranchisement in NC -- a textbook case of discriminatory intent if there ever was one.

And it seems like it'll come up in the Trump era.
