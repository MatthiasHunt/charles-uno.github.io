In 1920, the [Eighteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) to the US Constitution prohibited the "manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors." More than a decade later, the [Twenty-First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) ended Prohibition in a single sentence[^1]:

> The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed.

[^1]: The complete text is actually three sentences, but you get the idea. 

There's an undeniable appeal to such crisp, concise finality. It cuts straight to the heart of the issue -- no appendix, no jargon, no mandates, no thresholds. Its meaning is immediately clear to lawmakers and laypeople alike.

That said, a wonkish solution would likely have been better[^5] than an outright repeal. Prohibition was an imperfect solution to a very real problem. In the early 20th century, alcoholism was widespread, leading to high levels of cirrhosis, alcoholic psychosis, and domestic violence. Prohibition succeeded in changing some of the destructive cultural norms surrounding alcohol. Until the country was shaken by the onset of the Depression, it was even popular! More than anything else, the problem with prohibition was in its enforcement[^3], which could have been significantly reformed. 

[^5]: It's hard to say what the "correct" level of restriction is for alcohol sale and/or consumption. In the 1920s, we erred on the side of too much restriction -- but it's also possible to have too little. There are [societal costs](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/16/opinion/actually-prohibition-was-a-success.html) associated with alcohol, such as [10k deaths per year](https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html) due to drunk drivers. 

[^3]: Prohibition was laid out in the Eighteenth Amendment. Enforcement came a year later in the Volstead Act. The 0.5% alcohol threshold in the Volstead Act was unexpectedly low -- many had expected beer (and even wine) to remain legal, as had been the case in local juristictions. Furthermore, the "concurrent power" clause gave the federal enforcers too much responsibility without enough resources, allowing crime organizations to operate lucrative black markets.

Today's politicians love to talk about their own one-sentence fixes to high-profile issues. Republicans want to [repeal the Affordable Care Act](https://www.tedcruz.org/l/repeal-obamacare/), and appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will [overturn Roe v Wade](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/trump-ill-appoint-supreme-court-justices-to-overturn-roe-v-wade-abortion-case.html). Democrats want to see a [reversal of Citizens United](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/hillary-clinton-citizens-united-225658) and [scrap the Electoral College](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/306121-dem-senator-introducing-bill-to-abolish-electoral-college) in favor of a national popular vote. In this respect, both sides are wrong. A complete reversal of an earlier policy is impractical, undemocratic, and ultimately a waste of everyone's time.

At its most fundamental level, democracy is about finding a bunch of people who disagree with one another, locking them in a room together, and yelling at them about our problems. 

The results are ugly, because they're not trying to find the perfect solution -- they're trying to kludge together majority approval. 

They can come back later and fix it. 

They do their best to solve those problems without creating new ones. The results are inevitably ugly, because it's not about being right, or finding the perfect solution -- it's about kludging together something that most people find acceptable, then moving on to the next problem. 




In the case of Obamacare, the problem was that healthcare was expensive, 




Because of the open-ended nature of democratic reform, no question is ever truly resolved. It's always possible to come back to it later. But in practice, each successive change is smaller than the last. 


The original solution wasn't perfect, but it generally solved a problem. If you repeal it, you have to deal with that problem all over again. 

Majority finds it to be a net win. 





- Getting bipartisan support by watering things down. 
- Writing up something rough and letting the courts sort out the details. 

No question is ever truly settled, but iterating brings convergence. 








It's not about being right, or finding the perfect solution, so much as it is about finding a compromise that everyone can live with. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd

Each is an imperfect solution to a real problem. Even if the solution is unpopular, there are probably parts that are popular -- for example, preexisting conditions in Obamacare. A clean repeal means we have to solve that old problem all over again. 


The whole point of democracy is wisdom of the crowd. Start with lots of different interest groups and try to kludge together something that everyone can live with. Sometimes that means one party writes a bill, and the other party gets its say later by reforming it. What *doesn't* get there is "repeal and replace." The Democrats passed a bill along party lines. The debate can never be over until the Republicans have their voices heard. That can mean reforming the bill (good) or repealing and replacing it (bad). If the Republicans repeal and replace Obamacare, what happens when Democrats retake the legislature? Going back and forth is good for nobody. Better to move toward consensus so we can be done with this conversation.

From a practical standpoint, none of these issues are as straightforward as they are made out to be. 

Before Citizens United, campaign finance was even messier than it is now. Jan Balan [wrote](http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/09/the-court-after-scalia-campaign-finance-law-wonderland/) on SCOTUSblog

> The current political rallying cry of critics ... is "reverse Citizens United!" This implies that all will be well if only that case is reversed, that there was a reasonable if not idyllic state of campaign finance prior to Citizens United. There was not. The laws struck down in Citizens United were merely the most recent regulatory gimmicks that met an unconstitutional fate, and there are decades of prior cases in the field which created a regulatory regime not contemplated by the original laws.

Some suggestion that the UK may have a [better model](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/12/daily-show-takes-on-the-mercifully-short-relatively-cheap-uk-election/) for campaign finance -- their election seasons are short, and far less money is spent. But the analogy is weak. The United States has 5x the population of the UK, spread over 40x the landmass. Plus, unlike the UK, we elect our executive directly (whereas the Prime Minister is chosen by Parliament). 

Obamacare is many interlocking pieces. The preexisting conditions clause is overwhelmingly popular... but it relies on the unpopular individual mandate. 

Repeal is tricky because -- per [Matt Lewis](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/25/maybe-on-obamacare-republicans-should-just-punt.html), a consistent critic of Obamacare:

> No matter the fate of the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama already accomplished a huge legacy-guaranteeing paradigm shift: It is now understood that it is the federal governmentâ€™s job to make sure everyone has access to health care insurance.

If only it were that simple!

Prohibition was a response to 19th century alcoholism, family violence, and "saloon-based political corruption"

alcohol consumption dropped during prohibition and remained low for a decade after its repeal.

Loss of tax revenue

Proliferation of organized crime

Prohibition didn't create so much of an expectation because it wasn't enforced? 

We still have weird laws and baggage about booze. 

---

Slavery! 

13th amendment did not abolish slavery in non-rebelling states

13th amendment has an exception -- slavery is still allowed as punishment for a crime. 

a century later, the Civil Rights Movement was clearly still dealing with the same baggage. 

---

Abortion, campaign finance, and healthcare are way more complicated than the legality of booze.

Electoral college. Democrats want to repeal it. Actually, with the exception of right after the 2000 and 2012 election (where the EC allowed Republican candidates to win the presidency despite losing the EV), a [consistent, bipartisan majority](http://www.gallup.com/poll/150245/americans-swap-electoral-college-popular-vote.aspx) of voters would prefer a national popular vote. Over the past two centuries, there have been [over 700 attempts](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html#changes) by Congress to eliminate the electoral college.

The electoral college is important because 51 small elections are easier than one big election. Removes the incentive for reliably blue states to rack up huge margins by dropping the voting age to 15, etc.

https://fee.org/articles/the-accidental-genius-of-the-electoral-college/

Without the EC, a close election would probably deadlock the country with litigation.

In 2000, Florida was very close. The election results were in limbo for a month before SCOTUS killed the recount.

2000 -- national vote within 0.5%

1968 -- 0.7%

1960 -- 0.2%

1884 -- 0.6%

Super-close elections are not actually that common, so 2000 is probably the only example we need. Imagine if we had to recount the whole country instead of just one state.

1967 paper estimating 800k abortions per year in the US:

population at that time was 200M.


population now is 320M. so that would scale up to 1.3M

just under 1M abortions in 2014, and falling

Nobody has outlawed abortion, but some states have gotten close. Hard to say what the abortion rate was before roe, but in those states there is evidence that DIY abortion is on the rise.

data from 1990-1994, 2010-2014. in both cases, no statistically significant correlation between abortion rate and legality.

35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44

It's better to look forward to what can be improved, as opposed to relying on rose-colored memories of how things were.
