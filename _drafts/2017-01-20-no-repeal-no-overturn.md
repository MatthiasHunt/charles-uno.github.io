In 1920, the [Eighteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) to the US Constitution prohibited the "manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors." More than a decade later, the [Twenty-First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) ended Prohibition in a single sentence[^1]:

> The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed.

[^1]: Well, that was the first part of it.

There's an undeniable appeal to such crisp, concise finality. It cuts straight to the heart of the issue -- no appendix, no jargon, no mandates, no thresholds. Its meaning is immediately clear to lawmakers and laypeople alike.

Today's politicians love to talk about their own one-sentence fixes to high-profile issues. Republicans want to [repeal the Affordable Care Act](https://www.tedcruz.org/l/repeal-obamacare/), and appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will [overturn Roe v Wade](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/trump-ill-appoint-supreme-court-justices-to-overturn-roe-v-wade-abortion-case.html). Democrats want to see a [reversal of Citizens United](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/hillary-clinton-citizens-united-225658).

If only it were that simple!

Prohibition was a response to 19th century alcoholism, family violence, and "saloon-based political corruption"

alcohol consumption dropped during prohibition and remained low for a decade after its repeal.

Loss of tax revenue

Proliferation of organized crime

Abortion, campaign finance, and healthcare are way more complicated than the legality of booze.

Electoral college. Democrats want to repeal it. Actually, with the exception of right after the 2000 and 2012 election (where the EC allowed Republican candidates to win the presidency despite losing the EV), a [consistent, bipartisan majority](http://www.gallup.com/poll/150245/americans-swap-electoral-college-popular-vote.aspx) of voters would prefer a national popular vote. Over the past two centuries, there have been [over 700 attempts](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html#changes) by Congress to eliminate the electoral college.

The electoral college is important because 51 small elections are easier than one big election. Removes the incentive for reliably blue states to rack up huge margins by dropping the voting age to 15, etc.

Without the EC, a close election would probably deadlock the country with litigation.

In 2000, Florida was very close. The election results were in limbo for a month before SCOTUS killed the recount.

2000 -- national vote within 0.5%

1968 -- 0.7%

1960 -- 0.2%

1884 -- 0.6%

Super-close elections are not actually that common, so 2000 is probably the only example we need. Imagine if we had to recount the whole country instead of just one state.

> The current political rallying cry of critics ... is "reverse Citizens United!" This implies that all will be well if only that case is reversed, that there was a reasonable if not idyllic state of campaign finance prior to Citizens United. There was not. The laws struck down in Citizens United were merely the most recent regulatory gimmicks that met an unconstitutional fate, and there are decades of prior cases in the field which created a regulatory regime not contemplated by the original laws.

1967 paper estimating 800k abortions per year in the US:

http://link.springer.com/article/10.2307/2060019


population at that time was 200M.


population now is 320M. so that would scale up to 1.3M

just under 1M abortions in 2014, and falling

More restrictive abortion laws lead to higher incidence of abortion-related deaths

1958 book estimating 200k to 1.2M

data from 1990-1994, 2010-2014. in both cases, no statistically significant correlation between abortion rate and legality.

6.9 women treated per 1000 women aged 15-44
35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44

It's better to look forward to what can be improved, as opposed to relying on rose-colored memories of how things were.
