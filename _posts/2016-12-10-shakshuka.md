Turn on the oven to 200C (400F). Roast **2 red bell peppers** for about 45 minutes, until blackened on the outside. When they come out of the oven, put them immediately into a bowl and cover them with a towel to steam. Leave the oven on.

While the peppers are in the oven, throw some **olive oil** and **3 diced onions** (about 1000 ml or 4 cups) in an oven-safe skillet. Cook them on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they caramelize to a deep brown. This may take half an hour or more. It's worth it.

After the peppers have steamed for 5-10 minutes, the blackened skin should slide off easily. (If it doesn't, use a knife to scrape it off.) Discard the skin and seeds, chop the peppers, and stir them in with the onions.

Add **5 cloves minced garlic** (probably about 30 ml or 2 tbs) and **5 ml each of cumin, paprika, caraway, turmeric, cayenne, salt, and black pepper** (1 tsp each). Stir this around until it starts to smell irresistible, just a few minutes, then add **800 ml diced tomatoes** (one 28-oz can). If available, go for the [fire roasted](https://www.muirglen.com/) ones. You may optionally also add bacon, kalamata olives, whole garlic cloves, and/or hot peppers.

Simmer everything together for 20 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, to melt all of the flavors into one another.

Cube **100 ml feta cheese** (1/2 cup) and press those cubes into the sauce. Then use a spoon to create 4 craters in the sauce, and crack **4 eggs** into those craters.

*Optionally, the sauce can be divided into ramekins before baking.*

Put the whole pan into the oven. Bake until the egg whites are just barely set, about 15 minutes. The yolks should still be runny. Serve promptly with crusty bread.
