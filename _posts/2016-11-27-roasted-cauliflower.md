Partition **one large head of cauliflower** (or two small heads) into 3cm (1 inch) florets. In a large bowl, toss with about **50ml (3T) olive oil**, until evenly coated. Sprinkle lightly with **salt** and heavily with **black pepper**.

Spread the cauliflower on a baking sheet so that none overlap. Roast at 230C (450F) for about half an hour, until the edges have caramelized. Serve promptly.

Have a spice or spice blend that you've been meaning to try out? Cauliflower is an excellent canvas! Personal favorites include [garam masala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garam_masala) and [berbere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbere).
