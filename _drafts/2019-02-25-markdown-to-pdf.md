If we're writing a document that'll be released to the public, Word (or similar) is probably the tool for the job. It can pull in a letterhead template, tweak fonts and colors, drop in some images, and wrap the text around them. With a bit of finagling, Word's under-the-hood HTML/CSS[^2] has the horsepower to do basically whatever we want.

[^2]: If you change the `.docx` extension to `.zip`, you can unzip a Word document and look at the HTML and style elements for yourself!

The thing is, a lot of times, I'm not looking to finagle. Word's default style looks mediocre, and I'd rather not fall down the rabbit hole of trying to fix it. And after a decade-plus of writing code, Word's mouse-heavy[^3] workflow feels like driving with the parking brake on. I just want to write my piece, hit a button, and have it look sharp!

[^3]: The mouse is intuitive, but the keyboard is a much faster way to enter information into a computer -- especially if it needs to be precise.

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) handles the first part nicely. 

Like Word, Markdown uses HTML under the hood to keep track of document structure. But whereas Word uses CSS to make things pretty and complicated, Markdown leaves out the cosmetic stuff completely. 





It lets us write the content and structure of a document without worrying about cosmetic details like font, color, spacing, and margins.

Markdown uses HTML under the hood, just like Word does, but without the CSS. 





To use web jargon, it's HTML without the CSS. 




Basically, Markdown is like that clunky [BBCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode) that web forums used in the nineties, but reinvented to be intuitive and legible. To emphasize a word, wrap it in asterisks (`*example*` -> *example*). To make a bulleted list, start each line with a dash, just like you would when writing an email. 


Basically, it's a nice way of writing the HTML for a website while ignoring the CSS. 


It can also handle headers, footnotes, block quotes, links, images, and so on. It's widely used in tech for documentation, and it's catching on for blogging as well. 

This page is written in Markdown. You can see it raw [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charles-uno/charles-uno.github.io/master/_drafts/2019-02-25-markdown-to-pdf.md).

The first part is easy.



- bold, italics
- code snippets and code blocks
- block quotes
- headers
- footnotes
- links
- images
- bulleted and numbered lists, including nested lists
- tables (yuck)
- horizontal rules

Step one: write in Markdown.

Step one: input in Markdown

Input-wise, I love working in Markdown.

It lets me easily express everything I want

GitHub and other version control sites render Markdown to HTML, but it's not exactly *nice*.

Basically, I'd rather be working in Markdown.


I'm a software engineer.
Don't make me click through GUI options every time I want footnotes or links or headers.
Working in plain text is kinda my thing

- plays nicely with version control

I spend a decent chunk of my time working with plain text: software engineering at work, number crunching [for fun](http://charles.uno/titan-breach-simulation/), and even a bit of code work as a volunteer[^1].

plain text is great

- it is exactly what it looks like
- no [invisible formatting](https://xkcd.com/2109/)
- never fall down the rabbit hole of
- copy-paste works like you expect
- plays nicely with version control

Microsoft Word is like a slap in the face

- wysiwyg
- click through menus for links, footnotes, headings
- default style settings look "average"

[^1]: Once in a while, I volunteer with the shop at the [Science Museum](https://www.smm.org/). They've got me poking around with a [CirCuitPython Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython) microcontroller -- figuring out how to use it for exhibit automation. Nothing written up about that yet, but if you're curious, my code is available [here](https://github.com/charles-uno/circuit-python).

The thing is, I'm not looking to finagle. I'm looking to write a report today that can impress my boss tomorrow.

polishing my proposal, not messing with my margins.

I want to write my stuff, worry minimally about formatting, and have it look sharp.

It takes a long time, and I'm not great at it. Plus it feels like overkill.

The goal is to look sharp, not to go viral.

I just need a tool I can trust to get the job done.

As the industry-standard tool, almost by definition, its defaults look average.

The thing is, I don't want to deal with nested menus, style options, invisible formatting,
