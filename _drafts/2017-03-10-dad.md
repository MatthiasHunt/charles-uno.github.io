When her husband died, my great aunt spoke to me about her grief, but also her relief. For a year after the stroke, she watched her partner of six decades fade away. He was bedridden and nonverbal. There was no hope of recovery. His passing was a weight lifted from her chest.

In the same sense, dad's passing is both heartbreaking and cathartic.

Dad was diagnosed with dementia at the age of 57. From there, watching his five-year decline was gut-wrenching. He lost his short-term memory and his sense of time. He became increasingly apathetic and sedentary. He stopped speaking. He stopped blinking.

It was impossible to know how much of him was left. Half of me ate lunch with him on Tuesdays, to give him the best possible quality of life. The other half hoped it didn't matter -- that he was already gone. I can't imagine anything more horrifying than being aware of your own mind unwinding.

With his passing, the emotional logjam has loosened, and I can try to make peace with the loss. "Dad" can be the man in my childhood memories -- not the empty-eyed body across the table, unable to chew its own pasta.

He taught me to ride a bike. Well, maybe "taught" is generous. He took off the training wheels and gave me a push.

My last memory of my dad, when he was still himself, has us standing in my first apartment. He had just helped me buy a car, or maybe set up some insurance. As he was leaving, he told me that he loved me. I noted to myself that saying so was out of character for him.

If he knew something was wrong, he never gave another indication.
