description: "They've both done the job. Biden did it better, and it's not close."

---

For the first time in over a century, both[^1] candidates for president have already held the office. 
This gives us the rare opportunity to ignore the campaign noise and ask directly: who[^2] was better at the job? 

I believe the answer is Biden, and I don't believe it's close.
His priorities are better.
He is more effective at enacting them.
You can check my work below.

[^1]: Under a parliamentary system, like in the UK, there can be three or more viable political parties. They form coalitions to create a majority government. The Electoral College makes that nearly impossible in the USA. Credible politicians here stick to the two major parties, and third parties are a joke. For example, despite 30+ years of attempts, the Green Party has [never won any election for state or federal office][green_officeholders]. Jill Stein, the Green candidate for president, has a laughably weak résumé: she served one and a half terms on city council.

[^2]: To be clear, this isn't really about Biden and Trump as individuals. This is about their administrations. The president's job is to make speeches and sign things. Just about everything else is delegated out. That's how so much can get done even when the president himself is older than dirt.

## Signature Legislation

Biden passed several significant bills despite a fifty-fifty tie in the Senate:

- [American Rescue Plan][arp] - $1,900 billion COVID stimulus. 
- [Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act][iija] (bipartisan) - $1,200 billion to modernize roads, bridges, broadband, public transit, etc.
- [Inflation Reduction Act][ira] - $500 billion for clean energy, the largest such investment in history. This spending was offset by an [estimated $700 billion][ira_cbo] in corporate tax hikes and IRS crackdowns on wealthy tax cheats.
- [CHIPs and Science Act][chips] (bipartisan) - $300 billion for domestic high-tech manufacturing and supply chains.
- [Safer Communities Act][biden_gun_control] (bipartisan) - $10 billion for school safety, first responders, crisis intervention programs, etc. This bill also expanded background checks, red flag rules, etc. It's the first gun safety law in nearly 30 years.

Trump had a larger majority in Congress than Biden, but he did less with it:

- [CARES Act][cares] (bipartisan) - $2,200 billion COVID stimulus.
- [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act][tcja] - $1,500 billion in tax cuts which [mostly benefited high-income households and corporations][tcja_impact].
- [EGRRCPA][trump_bank_deregulation] (bipartisan) - loosened some of the banking restrictions put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.

## The Economy

Biden's COVID stimulus package was [relatively generous][g20_stimulus_comparison], and he followed it up with a [big infrastructure bill][iija].
All that spending seems to have paid off.
The USA experienced a [smoother post-Covid recovery than other wealthy nations][post_covid_gdp]: lower unemployment, slower inflation, and faster GDP growth.
[Wages are rising][wage_growth], especially for [low-income workers][low_income_wages]. 
Income inequality is [falling][income_inequality_falling]. 

That all said, it's easy to give the president [too much credit][potus_economy] for the economy.
Markets crashed in 2020 because of COVID, not because of Trump.

## Israel and Palestine

Arab militias such as Hamas launch terrorist attacks at Israel (rockets, [suicide bombers][wiki_hamas_suicide_bombers], [sexual violence][hamas_rape]) then hide in the [tunnels under Palestinian cities][hamas_tunnels_not_bunkers]. 
Israel responds by bombing and [blockading][gaza_blockade] those cities, inevitably radicalizing the next round of militants. 
Experts have called this the world's [most intractable conflict][most_intractable_conflict].

Last October saw Hamas's largest attack yet: over a thousand Israeli civilians killed in a single day, plus hundreds more taken hostage.
Israel responded by invading Gaza to eradicate Hamas once and for all.
The civilian toll has been [catastrophic][gaza_casualties]: tens of thousands dead, over a million displaced, infrastructure in ruins. 
It's a humanitarian crisis.

Biden's policy is about the same we would have expected from Obama, Clinton, or even [George W Bush][gwb_against_settlements_gaza_aid]. 
He pledged ironclad support of Israel, sent military aid, and vetoed some stern letters from the UN.
He also leveraged the close US-Israel relationship to urge restraint, broker a ceasefire, and pursue lasting peace.
In particular:

- Biden brokered a [week-long ceasefire][gaza_ceasefire_2023] in November, and is [pursuing another][ceasefire_work_2024].
- Israel's immediate response to the attack included cutting off Gaza's access to clean water. [Biden convinced them to restore water][gaza_water_siege]. 
- Israel was reportedly planning to escalate the conflict by striking Helbollah militants in Lebanon. [Biden talked them down][no_lebanon_strike]. 
- He has repeatedly urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties, even threatening to [withhold arms][rafah_arms].
- Biden spent half a billion dollars to [build a temporary port][gaza_port] off Gaza for faster delivery of humanitarian aid. 
- He's pushing for [Palestinian statehood][palestinian_statehood] as part of a postwar plan.

In contrast, Trump's policies showed no interest in Israeli restraint or Palestinian sovereignty:

- Trump [withdrew US support][trump_peace_plan] for a two-state solution. 
- Trump endorsed further [Israeli settlements][trump_peace_plan] on occupied land.
- Trump [halted humanitarian aid][trump_halted_aid] to Palestine.
- Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing decades of precedent. The status of Jerusalem is a long-standing obstacle to peace.
- Trump blocked [immigration][trump_muslim_ban] and [refugee resettlement][trump_refugees] from Muslim nations.

## Russia and Ukraine

Ukraine ousted its pro-Russian president in 2014. 
[Russia invaded and annexed][russia_ukraine_war] the Crimea region soon after, and supported pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region.
In 2022, Russia launched a full invasion. 
Russia continues to occupy Ukranian land.

- Biden has signed [$175 billion][biden_ukraine_aid] in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
- He also set [clear guardrails][biden_ukraine_guardrails] to prevent direct conflict between nuclear powers.

Compared to:

- Trump [blocked $400 million of military aid][trump_ukraine_scandal] to Ukraine in 2019, then tried to blackmail Ukraine into fabricating dirt on his political opponents. He was impeached (though acquitted) for doing so. 
- At Trump's suggestion, Republican legislators also [delayed aid to Ukraine][trump_ukraine_2024] for several months in 2024.
