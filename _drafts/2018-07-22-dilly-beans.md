Based on a recipe by [Marisa McClellan](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/06/spicy-dilly-beans-recipe.html).

## Ingredients

The following is enough to make 1 quart. The photos show six.

- Beans to fill a quart jar (about 50 beans)
- 15 mL (1 T) black peppercorns
- 1 large garlic clove (or several small ones), peeled
- Half habanero[^2] pepper, seeds and stem removed
- 1 crown fresh dill
- 30 mL (2 T) canning/pickling salt[^1]
- 300 mL (1.25 c) water
- 300 mL (1.25 c) vinegar

[^1]: It's not safe to substitute regular salt for canning/pickling salt! The crystals are shaped differently, which affects how they measure. Swapping one for the other can mess with the chemistry of your brine, allowing dangerous bacteria to grow.

[^2]: Don't let the hot peppers scare you off! You don't actually eat them. They're just there to add flavor to the brine. In the past I've even used [Carolina Reapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Reaper), which are way too hot for me to cook with. The beans turned out spicy, but nothing crazy. Just be sure to wear gloves while working with them -- especially if you wear contact lenses!

## Steps

Fill your biggest pan with water and start it on high. The pan needs to be big enough to submerge filled jars for processing. It'll take a while for it to get going. Sterilize your empty jars by boiling them for ten minutes. Also boil your lids in a small pot of water to sterilize them.

Prepare your beans. Cut off the stems, as well as any blemishes. I like to cut off the pointy tail, but that's not strictly necessary. If any beans are too tall to fit comfortably in your jars, trim them to the appropriate length.

*Dill, peppers, etc should go in the bottom of the jar, below the beans*

Combine your salt, water, and vinegar in a saucepan and put the heat on high. While it comes to a boil, put the black pepper, hot pepper, garlic, and dill in the bottom of your jar(s). Then stuff as many beans as you can into each jar. Make sure not to bruise them, and leave half an inch of head space at the top of each jar.

Use a ladle or measuring cup to pour the brine over the beans and spices. Fill to half an inch from the top of the jar. Give the jar a wiggle, or poke around with a chopstick, to dislodge bubbles. Then wipe the rim clean, cap it, and screw the ring on loosely.

Return the jar to the large pan of boiling water and submerge it for ten minutes. This forces out air, ensuring that you get a good seal -- but careful not to boil for too long, as your beans will get mushy. After boiling, set your jars on the counter to slowly return to room temperature. Each should pop audibly as the cap seals.

Let the beans sit for a week before eating. Sealed jars are shelf stable for a year. Refrigerate after opening.
