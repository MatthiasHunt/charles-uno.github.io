Not long ago, Cray hired a [new SVP of R&D](https://www.hpcwire.com/2017/01/26/stathis-papaefstathiou-takes-rd-reins-cray/), who promised to drag the company kicking and screaming into this century. He wanted to see the adoption of industry-standard tools, [agile software development practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), pipeline automation, and embedded testing. Six months later, as if to drive home the urgency of these reforms, Cray [laid off](http://www.startribune.com/cray-to-idle-190-workers-about-14-percent-of-its-staff/435452993/) one out of every seven employees.

Linda, the director of testing and my boss-boss, found herself in the crosshairs. Testing at Cray was a central organization, with testers rarely embedded in development teams. Runs were orchestrated by a multi-decade patchwork of home-grown scripts -- barely an industry-standard tool in sight, and certainly not something that could be plugged into a build pipeline. And, of course, this shake-up was hitting us just as work on [Shasta](https://www.hpcwire.com/2018/10/30/cray-unveils-shasta-lands-nersc-9-contract/) (Cray's once-per-decade paradigm shift) was kicking into high gear.

From where I sat, it felt like the changes might be gradual. Testers were half-embedded in a few projects, getting involved early in the development process while remaining organizationally distinct. We tidied up our infrastructure, which seemed to go over well. Linda did her best to show the value of the test organization.

Shit hit the fan in July. The details are above my pay grade, but we saw two immediate changes:

- Testing in the pipeline suddenly became very important. Our infrastructure cleanup had been cute, but R&D was going all-in on Jenkins, Robot, and other third-party automation tools.
- Linda's right-hand-man, Dennis, took charge of our pipeline work for Q3 2018.

The next few months were rough. My aim isn't to air out dirty laundry, so I'll just say: Dennis is a Staff Engineer by virtue of his technical work, hardware knowledge, customer relationships, etc. He's experienced, knowledgeable, well-connected, and funny. But his skill set does not cover breaking down a goal, setting priorities, or delegating work.

Somewhere around here, I updated my resume.

The second shoe fell at the end of Q3. Of the thirty testers reporting to Linda, twenty would be reorganized into development teams in early 2019. The future was hazy for the other ten (including me). Some would remain testers, focused specifically on full-system testing. There would also be an infrastructure group, an integration group, and a system engineering group.



responsibilities unclear

moved forward trying to get ready for the transition. dennis once again running the team.

I made a lot of noise about pipeline work. seemed to me that it was pretty important, aligned with a big-picture vision. but we were pushed to instead take on low-risk tasks. assembling documentation. guidance on unit testing. investigating third-party tools. maybe trying to avoid stepping on toes, give the SVP exactly what he asked for, but in practice it's not clear who (if anyone) we were creating value for.


also networked with Gina, Dan, David to try to get us moved over.
In practice, I had been doing infrastructure work for a while. applied for a few DevOps positions within Cray. Had worked closely with the DevOps team while getting our pipeline set up.



also checked the box on LinkedIn that tells recruiters it's OK to contact you. started taking calls. Met a handful of them in person.




everything came together in mid-december, right before Cray's week-long holiday shutdown.

Town hall with Jose

Gina took a different position within Cray

Jose is Linda's boss -- and also Tara's boss. Tara is new. DevOps position is under a new director, and there is no manager.


On my plate all at once: Wells Fargo offer, DevOps, Storage






Gina. Existing manager. Is *great*.

I'm driven to climb, but don't have a long-term plan. Every time I was looking for more, Gina had something in her pocket. Would I like to mentor an intern? How about interface with a customer site? Jump onto a team of junior engineers and offer guidance? Direct the team from the Governance Board?

options: architect? management?

Offer from Storage. Would be very visible to the VP, Charlie.



Checked that box on LinkedIn that tells recruiters to contact me, and did they ever.

Spoke to probably a dozen different recruiters on the phone, and met with a handful in person. Got the most traction with a recruiter representing Wells Fargo.
