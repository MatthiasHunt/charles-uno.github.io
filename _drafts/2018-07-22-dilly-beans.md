Based on a recipe by [Marisa McClellan](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/06/spicy-dilly-beans-recipe.html).

## Ingredients

The following is enough to make 2 quarts. The photos show a triple batch.

- Beans to fill 2 quart jars (about 100 beans)
- 30 mL (1 oz) black peppercorns
- 2 large cloves garlic (or several small ones)
- 1 hot pepper
- 2 heads fresh dill
- 60 mL (4 T) canning/pickling salt[^1]
- 600 mL (2.5 c) water
- 600 mL (2.5 c) vinegar

[^1]: It's not safe to substitute regular salt for canning/pickling salt! The crystals are shaped differently, which affects how they measure. Swapping one for the other can mess with the chemistry of your brine, allowing dangerous bacteria to grow.

## Steps

Fill your biggest pan with water and start it on high. The pan needs to be big enough to submerge filled jars for processing. It'll take a while for it to get going.

Prepare your beans. Cut off the stems, as well as any blemishes. I like to cut off the pointy butt, but that's not strictly necessary. If any beans are too tall to fit comfortably in your jars, cut them in half -- or trim them to the appropriate length and eat the extra.

Peel the garlic cloves but leave them whole.

Prepare your peppers: halve them and remove the stems and seeds. If you're using super-hot peppers, you may want to wear gloves for this part.

Combine the salt, water, and vinegar in a saucepan and bring to a boil.

In a small pan, bring some water to a boil and submerge your canning lids.

Divide the garlic, peppercorns, pepper, and dill between a pair of quart jars.

Stuff as many beans as you can into each jar without bruising them. Leave at least half an inch of space at the top.

Once everything is boiling, pour brine over your beans. Give the jar a shake to dislodge bubbles. Then wipe the rim and cap it, screwing the ring on loosely.

Submerge the capped jar in boiling water for 10 minutes.

Allow to sit for a week before eating.
