Overturning Citizens United is like repealing Obamacare. It's a step backwards, to when the system was even messier than it is now.

It's better to look forward to what can be improved, as opposed to relying on rose-colored memories of how things were.

Walking something back is almost never the right answer... though Prohibition may be a counterexample.
