[^1]: To [roast bell peppers](/farm-freezer): Cut them in half and remove the seeds and stems. Bake open-side-down on parchment paper for about an hour at 400Â°F, until the skin blackens and puffs up. Allow to cool, then remove the skin. Roasted peppers also keep well in the freezer.

Start the onions and some olive oil in a large skillet. Cook them on medium-low heat until they caramelize to a deep brown. Stir them occasionally and add more olive oil if any corners start to scorch.

Add the peppers and the spices. Stir completely into the onions. Everything should smell amazing. Then add the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, stirring intermittently.

Press the feta cubes gently into the sauce. Then use a spoon to hollow six craters into the sauce and crack an egg into each. Cover the skillet and let it simmer until the egg whites are just set, about 10 minutes. You can check them by poking gently with a chopstick.

Enjoy promptly with pita or crusty bread. Serves about four people.

Note that the tomato sauce reheats well, but the eggs don't. It's better to fry a fresh egg in the morning and put that on top!
