Based on an analysis of all legal words in Wordle, the [best starting word][soare] is `SOARE`.
Or maybe, based on [information theory][crane], it's `CRANE`.
An [economist recommends][slice] `SLICE` if you want to minimize number of moves, or `ADEPT` if you want to minimize your odds to fail.
I personally start with `RATIO`, since I get the feeling that the author avoids[^1] the letter `E` to keep things interesting.
All these big-brain takes raise the question: how much does it really matter?

To investigate, I put together a computer simulation of Wordle (source code [here][source]).
The computer makes the first guess as specified, then chooses randomly from there.
Random choices are constrained by past clues; essentially, the computer plays on "hard mode"[^3].
By looking at the outcomes from thousands upon thousands of puzzles, we can get a sense for how important it is to carefully choose an opening word.

Before we get into the results, a quick disclaimer.
Wordle has two word lists.
There's a list of possible solutions (2,300 words) and a list of allowed guesses (12,900 words).
My model completely ignores the latter.
The vast majority of "real" words are in the solutions list, and the vast majority of the [non-solution words][non_solutions] are nonsense like `FEUAR` and `PEEOY`.



As far as I can tell, that's just not how people play Wordle.









Notably, the computer only chooses words from






[^3]: From an informal survey, it seems like most people play on hard mode, whether or not they've flipped the toggle.



The computer makes guesses randomly, with the exception of the first guess


The computer plays on hard mode.











If I start with `MOIST` because I think it's funny, am I really setting myself up for failure?
To figure it out, I taught my computer to play Wordle.








If one person starts with an optimized word like `SOARE`, and another starts with `MOIST` because it's funny, and a third picks a different random starting word every day, how different will your scoreboards end up?





start with `MOIST` because it's funny
or a random word
or even `XYLYL`, which is certainly a contender for the worst opening word




hard mode, coming up with words on the fly, probably only using real words







| First Guess | Average Guesses | Success Rate |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|:------------:|
| (Random)    |    4.02         |     98.1%    |
| `ADEPT`     |    3.92         |     98.9%    |
| `ADIEU`     |    4.03         |     97.4%    |
| `CRANE`     |    3.82         |     98.6%    |
| `MOIST`     |    3.92         |     98.8%    |
| `RATIO`     |    3.92         |     98.1%    |
| `SLICE`     |    3.84         |     98.8%    |
| `SOARE`     |    3.89         |     98.1%    |
| `XYLYL`     |    4.50         |     95.5%    |






> values tentative. plus or minus about 3%



There's a legal guesses list with 10k words and a legal solutions list with 2k words
we're basically assuming the second list is the "real" words that actual people use
certainly true for me






[^1]: The letter `E` appears more often than any other letter in English. However, `E` appeared in only 9 of the 31 Wordles in January 2022. Four other letters (`I`, `N`, `O`, and `R`) each appeared more often. Furthermore, there was only a single puzzle (`PERKY`) where `E` was the only vowel, while each other vowel was the only vowel repeatedly (for example, `U` was the only vowel in `WRUNG`, `SLUMP`, and `TRUSS`).

[^2]: Hard mode requires you to use all known clues every time. As far as I can tell, most people play this way already. So in practice it's more like a spell checker.
