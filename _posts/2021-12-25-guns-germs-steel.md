At the Battle of Cajamarca, 168 spaniards killed thousands of Incas and captured Emperor Atahualpa without suffering a single casualty. In Australia and Sub-Saharan Africa, early conflicts with Europeans were similarly lopsided. In his 1997 bestseller, Jared Diamond looks past the immediate causes (such as the titular guns, germs, and steel) in search of an ultimate cause. He brings together evolutionary biology, geography, and even linguistics to explain why different civilizations on different continents developed technologies at different rates.

Right off the bat, the author addresses the elephant in the room: it's not about race. Even if you believe that one race of people is innately smarter -- which the author emphatically does not -- that's not an ultimate cause. You'd still need to explain what caused the supposed difference in intelligence within the human species.

Wildly different in terms of technology
How did this happen?


In a word, the answer is wheat.
Early humans in the americas domesticated corn.
In africa, millet and teff
