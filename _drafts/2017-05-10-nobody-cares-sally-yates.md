Kernel of truth in birtherism: obama is black.
Kernel of truth in Trump+Russia:

- Per the FBI, hackers associated with the Russian government meddled in the 2016 election with the intention of helping Trump.
- Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager, resigned due to shady links with Russia.
- Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security advisor, resigned due to lying about his communication with the Russian ambassador

I follow politics. I have a paid subscription to The Economist and read everything on FiveThirtyEight's RSS feed.

If I didn't watch those hearings, nobody did. 90% of voters don't know or care who Sally Yates is.


Same for Franken v Gorsuch. Folks were trying to make it go viral.


Keep the cast small. "Trump administration." It doesn't matter if it's Sessions, Tillerson, etc. They are all representatives of Trump.

With Trump, there are a few potential narratives.

- Trump is brazenly self-serving. Golfing. Hosting things at his own properties. Tax break that benefits himself hugely. Giving way too many responsibilities to his unqualified son-in-law. Melania staying in NY, at significant cost to the taxpayer[^1].

- Trump is an embarassing clown. Tweets. Meeting with China. Meeting with Germany. Talking to Taiwan. "Who knew healthcare was so complicated?" "Why did the Civil War happen?"

- Trump doesn't value fundamental freedoms. Congratulating Erdogan, but not the centrist French president. Threatening to crack down on the press.

-


[^1]: We pay whatever it takes to keep the president and his family safe. But in the past, the first family has adjusted its lifestyle in good faith.
