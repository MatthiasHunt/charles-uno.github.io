First, a few facts

About half of fetuses are aborted naturally by the body, usually due to chromosomal defects. At the moment of conception, there's only a 50-50 chance it's viable.

Pretty much nobody saves it for marriage

A significant majority of Americans are sexually active before the end of high school

Colorado contraception program. Free iuds are EXTREMELY effective at reducing the abortion rate.

Women choose to have abortions. Supply and demand. You can attach the supply via restrictive legislation to increase the price... or you can reduce the supply by decreasing the number of unwanted pregnancies

Best predictor of abortion rates is poverty

Restrictive policies

UK: generally banned after x weeks

Guttmacher survey... is there better and more recent data?

Here's an interesting angle:

Pregnancy is organ donation. It weakens one body to sustain another. The donor accepts all sorts of physical risks and consequences as part of the process.

When engaged in voluntarily, the process is beautiful. But the idea of government-mandated organ donation is appalling, even in the case of a parent donating to their own child.

Catholic church tolerates abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy. Fetus grows in the fallopian tube instead of the womb. Dangerous for both -- but there are recorded cases of both surviving birth.

Scholarly tradition. They have to admit that biology is complicated.

Half of all conceptions are naturally aborted by the body, usually before the woman even knows she's pregnant. Chromosomal issues.
