Both[^1] candidates for president in 2024 already know their way around the White House. 
Kamala Harris, a Democrat, is the current vice president. 
Donald Trump, a Republican, was president from 2017 to 2021. 
This gives us the rare opportunity to compare them directly. 
Skip the pearl-clutching about tweets, crimes[^3], and campaign drama. 
Between the current administration and the former, who has the better record?

[biden_endorses_harris]: https://apnews.com/article/biden-drops-out-2024-election-ddffde72838370032bdcff946cfc2ce6

[^1]: Under a parliamentary system, like in the UK, there can be three or more viable political parties. They form coalitions to create a majority government. The Electoral College makes that nearly impossible in the USA. Credible politicians here stick to the two major parties, and third parties are a joke. For example, despite 30+ years of attempts, the Green Party has [never won any election][green_officeholders] for state or federal office. Jill Stein, the Green candidate for president, has a laughably weak résumé: she served one-and-a-half terms on city council. 
[^3]: [Trump was convicted][trump_conviction] of business fraud after leaving office. Not ideal, obviously, but history shows that sometimes a slimeball can be an effective president. Just look at [LBJ][lbj_slimeball] or [Bill Clinton][clinton_slimeball]. Better to judge Trump by the performance of his administration. 

[^0]: Harris is Biden's hand-picked successor. She was on the ticket with him when he was elected, and by his side for his entire presidency. 
[^2]: Biden ran uncontested in his party's primary, as incumbents often do. Then, after a weak debate spiraled into concerns about his age, he bowed out. Switching candidates so late in the election season is very unusual.

To be clear: this is a big question. 
The president has a lot of responsibilities. 
They sign legislation, run the executive branch, direct foreign policy, command the military, and more.
Each dimension is important in its own way.
So let's be systematic. 

> TODO: caveat about VP vs prez. Harris is not in the drivers seat. we will probably never know how much came down to her personally. But (1) this is a team sport, (2) biden choosing her as VP suggests that she is closely aligned. also worth noting that trump's cabinet would have a lot of new faces since his original cabinet mostly no longer backs him


## Crisis Response

**When the nation is shaken by a crisis, it's the president's job to reassure and unite Americans.**

The COVID pandemic struck in the last year of Trump's presidency. 
The global economy crashed. 
Trump signed the bills that Congress put on his desk, but also lied to Americans and undermined the US pandemic response.

- Congress passed $3,200 billion for [vaccine development][trump_covid_vaccine_development], [paid leave][trump_covid_paid_leave], and [direct][trump_stimulus] [support][trump_additional_stimulus] for Americans and businesses. Trump signed them. But he also undercut US pandemic response by downplaying the severity of the virus, contradicting public health officials, elevating conspiracy theories, and discouraging precautions. The COVID death rate under Trump was very high compared to other wealthy nations, especially in [pro-Trump areas][covid_death_partisan_gap]. The estimated impact is [150,000][trump_covid_mismanagement_impact] preventable American deaths.

When Biden/Harris took office, the economy was in the shitter. 
Their hands were steady on the wheel during the recovery. 

- Shortly after Biden/Harris took office, Democrats passed $1,900 billion in [additional COVID stimulus spending][bh_stimulus_bill] without Republican support. This made pandemic support in the US [more generous][g20_stimulus_comparison] than in most of Europe. Our economy [recovered faster][post_covid_gdp] too. We saw lower unemployment, slower inflation, and faster GDP growth. [Wages are rising][wage_growth], especially for [low-income workers][low_income_wages]. Income inequality is [falling][income_inequality_falling].

## Domestic Legacy

**The president does not write legislation. But as the head of government, it's their job to set the agenda and work with Congress to get it done. Legislation signed by a president can impact Americans for decades after the president leaves office, as can the federal judges they nominate.**

Like past Republicans, Trump nominated anti-abortion judges and signed a tax cut for the rich. 
He also tried to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, but had trouble getting Congress on board. 

- [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act][trump_tax_cuts] --- $1,500 billion tax cut which [mostly benefited the rich][trump_tax_cuts_analysis]. The onset of the pandemic makes it hard to judge the long-term effects, but [similar tax cuts][bush_tax_cut_analysis] in the past have worsened income inequality and failed to spur economic growth. 
- Trump nominated three justices to the Supreme Court. He promised his voters that they would overturn Roe v Wade. [They did][dobbs]. This had been a long-term goal of religious conservatives. Women in many states can no longer access abortions, [even in the case of emergencies][emergency_abortion_post_dobbs]. The ruling also [explicitly][thomas_overturn_marriage] opened the door to rolling back contraception access and same-sex marriage. 
- Trump faced off with Congress over funding for a border wall to reduce undocumented immigration[^6], resulting in a [35-day government shutdown][trump_wall_shutdown]. He ultimately secured [about][wall_funding_2018] [$5 billion][wall_funding_2019] from Congress, then redirected another $10 billion from elsewhere. By the end of his term he had built [50 miles of new wall][trump_wall_outcome] of the proposed 1,300 miles. 
- Trump met with leaders in Congress to negotiate an [infrastructure][trump_infrastructure] bill, but no such bill was produced.

<!-- 
- He signed a bipartisan bill to [loosen banking regulations][trump_bank_deregulation] put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Several banks subsequently made risky investments and [collapsed][bank_failures_2023].

Biden/Harris had a narrower majority in Congress, but they got more done.

- [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law][bh_infrastructure_bill] (bipartisan) --- $1,200 billion to modernize roads, bridges, public transit, broadband, and so on. This had been a [long-term goal][obama_and_trump_infrastructure] for both parties. 
- [Inflation Reduction Act][ira] --- $500 billion for clean energy, the largest such investment in history. This spending was offset by an [estimated $700 billion][ira_cbo] in corporate tax hikes and IRS crackdowns on wealthy tax cheats.
- [CHIPs and Science Act][bh_chips] (bipartisan) --- $300 billion to strengthen domestic high-tech manufacturing and supply chains.
- [Safer Communities Act][bh_gun_control] (bipartisan) --- $10 billion for school safety, first responders, and crisis intervention programs. This bill also strengthened background checks and red flag rules. This was the first federal gun law in 30 years. 
- [Respect for Marriage Act][bh_marriage_bill] (bipartisan) --- Established protections for same-sex and interracial marriages in case the conservative Supreme Court majority [overturns][thomas_overturn_marriage] the 2015 marriage equality ruling.
- Biden/Harris negotiated a [bipartisan immigration reform bill][immigration_bill_2023] to combat drug smuggling and speed up the years-long asylum process. Republicans withdrew support for the bill at Trump's request.

<!--
- He added a new federal holiday: [Juneteenth][juneteenth], which celebrates enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation.
- They passed the bipartisan [Electoral Count Reform Act][bh_electoral_reform] with updates and clarifications to the presidential election process. This law closes the loopholes that [Trump attempted to use in 2020 to overturn the election][trump_fake_electors].-->

## Executive Effectiveness 

**The president leads the executive branch of the federal government, which has over a million employees. They hand-select department heads and sign executive orders to steer priorities. Executive orders can be enacted unilaterally, without approval from Congress. But they can likewise be rolled back unilaterally by the next administration.**






- Trump withdrew the US from the [Paris Climate Agreement][trump_paris_agreement] to mitigate climate change. 
- He also rolled back Obama-era regulations on [methane emissions][trump_methane_rollback], [fuel efficiency][trump_car_emission_rollback], and [toxic chemicals][trump_epa_pfas]. 
- Trump made it more difficult to access [food stamps][trump_snap_cuts]. As a result, nearly a million low-income Americans lost benefits.
- Trump made several attempts to [sabotage Obamacare][trump_aca_mandate_repeal] such as repealing the individual mandate, defunding the enrollment website, and blocking subsidy payments. The uninsured rate went up for the first time since Obamacare went into effect.
- Trump implemented a policy of [separating families at the border][family_separation] to deter asylum seekers. Thousands of children (including infants) were held in federal custody. A judge later ordered Trump to reunite the families, but doing so took years due to poor recordkeeping.
- He [steeply reduced refugee resettlement][usa_refugees_by_year] while in office, and completely blocked [immigrants][trump_muslim_ban] and [refugees][trump_refugees] from Muslim-majority nations. 
- Trump [banned][trump_transgender_policies] transgender Americans from serving in the military. He also rolled back protections for transgender students, patients, and inmates. 

- The tax cut bill also eliminated the [Obamacare individual mandate][trump_aca_mandate_repeal].

[^6]: We have 10+ million immigrants living in the USA without documentation, with more showing up all the time. This issue is trotted out every election season because it sounds scary. It's mostly hot air. Undocumented immigrants grow the economy by working and spending. They [pay more in taxes][immigrants_good_for_economy] than they use in benefits. And they have a [lower crime rate][illegal_immigrant_low_crime] than native-born Americans.

## Global Leadership 

**The president is the Commander in Chief of the US military. They're also the top authority on US foreign policy (though treaties and aid must be approved by Congress).**

Trump's foreign policy was more nativist than any other post-WW2 president.
He walked away from multinational agreements.
He made broad use of tariffs to "win" at international trade.
And he supported the aggression of strongmen in Israel and Russia against their neighbors. 

- Trump [blocked military aid to Ukraine][trump_ukraine_scandal] to fend off aggression by Russia. He then tried to blackmail Ukraine's government into fabricating dirt on his political opponents. He was impeached (though acquitted) for doing so. At Trump's suggestion, Republican legislators also [delayed aid to Ukraine][trump_ukraine_2024] for several months in 2024.
- Trump supported Israel, with no consideration for Palestinian sovereignty. He [withdrew US support][trump_peace_plan] for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. He endorsed further [Israeli settlements][trump_peace_plan] on occupied land. He [halted humanitarian aid][trump_halted_aid] to Palestine. And he officially [recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel][trump_jerusalem][^5]. Each of these actions broke decades of bipartisan precedent. 
- Trump withdrew US support from the multinational [Iran Deal][trump_iran_deal], which had been effective at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. 
- He withdrew the US from [TPP][tpp], a trade deal meant to balance China's influence in the Pacific. He withdrew US support from the [World Health Organization][trump_who] during the COVID pandemic. 
- He removed the US from the the [UN Human Rights Council][trump_un_hrc] and [UNESCO][trump_unesco]. 
- He [threatened to withdraw the US from NATO][trump_nato], but did not follow through.
- Trump imposed broad [tariffs][trump_tariffs] on China in attempt to shrink the trade deficit. He also imposed narrower tarrifs worldwide, including on our closest allies. Retaliatory tariffs hit agricultural producers hard, necessitating a $28 billion bailout. The [cost][trump_china_trade_war_size] to [American consumers][trump_tariffs_size] was over $350 billion. GDP and job creation were also negatively affected. There was [no lasting impact][trump_trade_war_effects] to US-China trade patterns.
- Trump negotiated [updates to NAFTA][trump_nafta], the trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the USA.

[^5]: The status of Jerusalem is a long-standing obstacle to peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The city is culturally important to both sides. 

Biden prioritized multinational coalitions to counter aggression from Russia and China. 
He also attempted to reduce US involvement in the Middle East, with mixed results.

- Biden led the international response to [Russia's invasion of Ukraine][bh_ukraine_leadership]. He signed [$175 billion][bh_ukraine_aid] in military and humanitarian aid. He also established [clear guardrails][bh_ukraine_guardrails] to prevent direct conflict between nuclear powers.
- Biden strengthened relationships with [Australia][bh_pacific_australia], [India][bh_pacific_india], [Japan][bh_pacific_japan_korea], [Papua New Guinea][bh_pacific_png], [the Phillipines][bh_pacific_phillipines], and [South Korea][bh_pacific_japan_korea] in order to counter aggressive behavior from China and North Korea. 
- Biden sent support to Israel after the October 2023 terrorist attack and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza[^4]. He also leveraged the close US-Israel relationship to pursue peace. He talked Israel back from the [water siege of Gaza][gaza_water_siege]. He brokered a [week-long ceasefire][gaza_ceasefire_2023] in November 2023, and is [pursuing another][ceasefire_work_2024]. He has repeatedly urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties, even threatening to [withhold arms][rafah_arms]. He built a [temporary port][gaza_port] off Gaza for faster delivery of humanitarian aid. And he's pushing for [Palestinian statehood][palestinian_statehood] as part of a postwar plan.
- [Biden withdrew the last US forces from Afghanistan][afghanistan_withdrawal], ending 20 years of occupation. The Taliban attacked during the final stages of the withdrawal, killing 13 American soldiers and toppling the Afghani government.
- Biden all but ended the US [drone war in Yemen][yemen_drone_war]. There have been 4 strikes under Biden (compared to 100+ under Trump).

<!-- - Biden launched [airstrikes against Houthi militants in Yemen][bh_houthi_airstrikes] to stop their attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The strikes were supported by NATO and a handful of other nations. -->

[^4]: Hamas launches terrorist attacks at Israel (rockets, [suicide bombers][wiki_hamas_suicide_bombers], [sexual violence][hamas_rape]) then hide in the [tunnels under Palestinian cities][hamas_tunnels_not_bunkers]. Israel responds by bombing and [blockading][gaza_blockade] those cities, inevitably radicalizing the next round of militants. Experts have called this the world's [most intractable conflict][most_intractable_conflict]. Last October saw Hamas's largest attack yet: over a thousand Israeli civilians killed in a single day, plus hundreds more taken hostage. Israel responded by invading Gaza to eradicate Hamas once and for all. The civilian toll has been [catastrophic][gaza_casualties]: tens of thousands dead, over a million displaced, infrastructure in ruins. It's a humanitarian crisis.

## Constitutional Integrity

**The Constitution lays out the process for elections and the peaceful transfer of power. It's the foundation upon which the entire government is built. The president is sworn to uphold it.**

Trump [baselessly denied][trump_big_lie] the legitimacy of his 2020 election loss.
He attempted to overturn the results and remain in power. 
If Trump's coup (or [soft coup][soft_coup]) had been successful, it would have been the end of the Constitution and the republic.
Elections would be meaningless.
He would be dictator for life.

> TODO: ignoring subpoenas? documents case? not even clear if it's worth mentioning these

- Trump called the top election official in Georgia and pressured him to [fabricate votes][ga_sos_call]. He has since been indicted for doing so. The trial date has not yet been set. Several of his co-conspirators have already pled guilty. 
- He recruited electors in seven states to submit [fraudulent results][trump_fake_electors].
- He [incited a mob][jan_6] to storm the capitol and disrupt the certification of his loss. He was impeached for doing so, but not convicted. [Hundreds of rioters][jan_6_convictions] have been convicted.

This is unprecedented in American history.
Biden has done nothing even remotely comparable.

- Obama and Biden left office without incident after Trump won the 2016 election. 
- As president, Biden signed [updates to the election process][bh_electoral_reform] to close the loopholes Trump attempted to exploit.

## Summary


<!--
Biden is an effective center-left president.
He led the US through a comparatively smooth COVID recovery. 
He shepherded a slew of bipartisan bills through Congress.
He passed the largest-ever investment in clean energy. 
He ended the 20-year war in Afghanistan.
And he reaffirmed America's commitment to our global allies. 

Trump is a knee-jerk reactionary with a mediocre understanding of civics. 
He signed a tax cut for the rich, then couldn't get anything else through Congress.
He presided over the longest-ever federal government shutdown. 
He actively undermined the pandemic response of his own administration. 
He started, and lost, a trade war with China. 
He engaged in needless cruelty against asylum seekers and their children.
And, worst of all, he brazenly prioritized his own political power over his oath to the Constitution. 

One of these men will be president next year. 
Please vote to help ensure it's the better one.
