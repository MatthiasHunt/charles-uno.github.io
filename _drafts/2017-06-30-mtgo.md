Dear X,

I've played Magic for 20 years. I'm now asking for 5 minutes of your time. We need to talk about Magic Online.

Parts of this won't be fun to read, but please stay with me. I work as a system test engineer; it is my job to offer constructive criticism of software, and I am good at it.

Crashes. This is an urgent bug.

Estimates $300M for Magic, at least 30% online

1 draft/min
8 players/draft
$12/player
so $100/min from this league

60 minutes/day
10 hours/day
7 days/week
50 weeks/year

That comes out to about $20M/year from this league. That's believable -- there are other leagues, but this is probably among the largest.
