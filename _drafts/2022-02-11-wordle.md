Based on an analysis of all legal words in [Wordle][wordle], the [best starting word][soare] is `SOARE`.
Or maybe, using [information theory][crane], it's `CRANE`.
An [economist recommends][slice] `SLICE` if you want to minimize number of moves, or `ADEPT` if you want to minimize your odds to fail.
I personally start with `RATIO`, since I get the feeling that the author avoids[^1] the letter `E` to keep things interesting.
All these big-brain takes raise the question: how much does it really matter?

[^1]: The letter `E` appears in far more possible solutions than any other letter. However, four other letters (`I`, `N`, `O`, and `R`) appeared in more Wordles in January 2022. On top of that, there was only a single puzzle (`PERKY`) where `E` was the only vowel, while each other vowel appeared on its own repeatedly (for example, `U` was the only vowel in `WRUNG`, `SLUMP`, and `TRUSS`).

To investigate, I put together a computer simulation of Wordle (source code [here][source]).
The first guess can be specified.
Each subsequent guess is chosen randomly, taking into account all past clues.
Essentially, the computer plays in hard mode[^2] and always goes with the first compatible guess that pops into its head.
By applying that strategy to thousands upon thousands of puzzles, we can get a sense for the importance of a good opening word.

[^2]: From an informal survey, it seems like most people follow the rules of hard mode, whether or not they've flipped the toggle.

*My code can generate and solve about a thousand random Wordle puzzles per minute on my laptop. And, because it uses the solutions list, it's pretty good about sticking to "real" words.*

Before we get into the results, a quick disclaimer.
Wordle has two word lists.
There's a list of possible solutions (2,300 words) and a list of allowed guesses (12,900 words).
The vast majority of "real" words are in the solutions list, while the [non-solution words][non_solutions] are mostly nonsense like `KYLIX` and `UMIAQ`.
In the interest of imitating human play patterns, the model completely ignores the non-solution word list.

I ran each of the starting words from above through 40,000 simulated puzzles.
Then I did the same with a variety of other starting words for comparison: `ADIEU` (lots of vowels), `LYMPH` (no vowels), `GEESE` (duplicate vowels), `JERKY` (uncommon consonants), `FLUFF` (duplicate consonants), `MOIST` (funny), and `XYLYL` (possibly the [worst starting word][soare]).
Results are shown in the table below:

| First Guess | Win Rate (±0.5%) | Average Guesses (±0.02) |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-----------------------:|
| `ADEPT`     |         98.8%    |            3.92         |
| `ADIEU`     |         97.4%    |            4.02         |
| `CRANE`     |         98.5%    |            3.82         |
| `FLUFF`     |         97.4%    |            4.39         |
| `GEESE`     |         97.6%    |            4.21         |
| `JERKY`     |         96.9%    |            4.25         |
| `LYMPH`     |         98.8%    |            4.10         |
| `MOIST`     |         98.7%    |            3.92         |
| `RATIO`     |         98.0%    |            3.91         |
| `SLICE`     |         98.8%    |            3.84         |
| `SOARE`     |         97.9%    |            3.88         |
| `XYLYL`     |         95.7%    |            4.50         |

Regardless of your starting word, you will generally be able to solve the daily Wordle.
Even `XYLYL`, which includes duplicate letters and no vowels, leads to solutions more than 95% of the time.
That's about 349 wins and 16 losses over the course of a year.
Pretty much any "real" word wins at least 97% of puzzles (11 losses per year), and even the most efficient words fall short of 99% (4 losses per year).
Due to small-number statistics[^4], that sort of difference won't be visible week-over-week, or even month-over-month.

[^4]: Statistical uncertainty is tricky for [small numbers][sqrt_n]. Over the course of 365 samples, a 2% failure rate will show up about 5-11 times. A 3% failure rate will show up about 7-13 times. That's a lot of overlap!

*Wordle-style graphs for a handful of starting words. No surprises here. The best starting words also have the best odds of winning faster.*

Your opening word has a bigger impact on your expected number of guesses, though it's still not huge.
With a top-tier starting word like `CRANE` or `SLICE`, you should expect to enter about 27 guesses over the course of a week.
A few steps down, `JERKY` averages 30 guesses per week  while still being a "real" word.
That's a big enough difference (and a big enough sample size) to show up in your stats over the course of a month or two.

In short, you can pick whatever starting word you want in Wordle.
You might win less on average, but the difference is quite small.

Failures are generally bad luck (or brain farts) rather than opening word
