I've read the DevOps Handbook
I read charity.wtf


Monoliths are good, actually!
- Sharing code between endpoints is easy
- No friction between versions
- Function calls are faster and easier than API calls
- Easier integration testing
- Let most of your engineers take containerization for granted

Oncall rotations are a single source of truth for ownership
- Every file, test, dashboard, alert, etc is owned by an oncall
- Each oncall has one designated response person at a time
- Most engineers are on an oncall rotation
- Oncall rotation size should be small enough that everyone has enough context to respond
- Oncall rotation should be big enough to avoid burnout

What does good logging feel like?
- Anyone can easily create an index pattern to store structured data
- Anyone can easily tick a counter or timer
- Anyone can easily create a metric/dashboard from that data
- Retention for structured data can be just a few days
- Counters and timers are cheap to store, good for long term trends


scaling tools. auto format. VS Code integration with version control. click to copy. click to open in VS Code
