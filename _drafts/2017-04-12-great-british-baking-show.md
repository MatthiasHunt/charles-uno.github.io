After watching the first episode of the Great British Bake Off, you might think you have a sense for which bakers are at the top (and bottom) of the pile.

In the first episode of Series 4 (Season 2[^1]), for example, Ruby is reduced to tears after curdling her crème pâtissière in the signature challenge; it's judged to be "awful." Then, in the technical challenge, she botches her angel food cake so badly that she has to start over... then runs out of time. She survives that episode -- Toby gets cut after mixing up salt and sugar -- but it seems like she's in over her head.

[^1]: Due to copyright issues, the BBC's Great British *Bake Off* is broadcast in the US as the Great British *Baking Show*. The seasons are also shuffled. Series 5 is on Netflix as Season 1; Series 4 is Season 2; etc.

Luckily for Ruby, the first episode of each season tells us very little about how that season will progress. If we compare first-episode technical rank against the number of episodes each baker survives, we get [Rexthor](https://xkcd.com/1725/). Some of the first episode's top technical bakers make it all the way to the finals, while others are eliminated early in the season. There's no particular correlation.

*Data comes from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off_(series_1)). Points are plotted at a slight offset from the lattice points to improve legibility. Series 1 and 2 are omitted due to having a different number of episodes.*

Admittedly, our data set isn't great. Signature challenges and showstoppers are not scored numerically, and the banter between the hosts and judges is dramatically vague. We're comparing technical rank and episode count, ultimately, because those are the numbers we have.

But even considering the kludgey data, the lack of correlation is surprising. We intuitively expect the worst bakers to be eliminated early in the season. And we expect the best bakers to perform well in the technical challenges. In the first week, those expectations do not line up with the numbers.

In the second week, on the other hand, a pattern is clear:

*Scoring well in the second episode's technical challenge is a decent predictor that a baker will make it to the finals. Technical rank in the first episode has no such predictive power.*

If a baker places in the top 3 in the first week's technical challenge, we haven't got a clue whether or not they'll make it to the finals. In the second week -- on average -- 2 of the top 3 technical bakers will make it to the finals.

This suggests that the competition is not decided by the bakers' intrinsic abilities. Creativity, attention to detail, and time management skills would all be apparent from the beginning. But there is one big thing the bakers have in the second episode that they didn't have in the first: experience with Paul and Mary. 

In the first episode, the bakers came in blind[^2]. 




[^2]: CHECK THIS! Probably not literally true. Not sure how auditioning works, and they are probably familiar with the show. But the first episode is the first time they get to see Paul and Mary live-judge dozens of bakes. 





There's just one big difference between the first and second episodes. Bakers come into the first episode blind. At the start of the second episode, on the other hand, they've had a chance to scope out the competition. Perhaps more importantly, they've also had a front-row seat to Paul and Mary judging dozens of bakes.

This is interesting because, as each season progresses, it's apparent to the viewer than some bakers *are* better than others.

Chetna and Kimberley deliver consistent, interesting flavors.

- good bake
- novel presentation
- exciting flavors

Norman and Glenn ... and Beca? were clearly getting outclassed.

working hard, but still near the bottom of the pack. less consistent, but also less ambitious.

were clearly getting outclassed -- performing poorly

It turns out, that's not the case. At the start of Series 4, the top technical bakers are Rob and Lucy -- both of whom are eliminated in the first half of the season.

This is not to say that the eliminations are random (they're not), or that technical challenges don't matter (they do), or even that all the bakers are equally good (they're not).
