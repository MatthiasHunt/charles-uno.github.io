It's illegal to harvest blood or organs from a corpse, even to save the life of a child. As long as that remains true, any law restricting abortion is absurd on its face. A pregnant person deserves at least that same level of bodily autonomy as a corpse.

Carrying a pregnancy to term comes with nontrivial risks for the pregnant person

Half of all conceptions are naturally aborted, usually before the woman even knows she's pregnant. If anyone truly believed life begins at conception, there would be resources here.

Catholic church tolerates abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy. Fetus grows in the fallopian tube instead of the womb. Dangerous for both -- but there are recorded cases of both surviving birth. Scholarly tradition. They have to admit that biology is complicated.

"life begins at conception" has trouble with TWINS
