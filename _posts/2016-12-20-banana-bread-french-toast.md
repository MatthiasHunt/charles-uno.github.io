## Banana Bread

- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 4 overripe bananas[^1]
- 2/3 cup dark brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1/3 cup butter, softened
- 1 t baking soda
- 1 t salt
- 1 t vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup mini dark chocolate chips[^2]

---

Preheat oven to 375Â°F.

Combine the bananas, brown sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking soda. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ones. The mixture should have about the consistency of yogurt; if it's too wet, add a bit more flour.

[^1]: Optionally, bananas can be swapped out for 14 oz cooked/canned sweet potato, pumpkin, butternut squash, or similar.

Add the chocolate chips, then spoon the batter into a buttered loaf pan[^3]. Bake until a toothpick in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Allow the loaf to cool, then carefully remove it from the pan. Banana bread can be stored at room temperature for a few days; keep a towel over it to prevent it from going stale.

Turn off the oven, put a towel over the loaf, and let it sit overnight. The ends of the loaf make for unsightly french toast, so you should probably just eat them.

[^2]: Chopped nuts and dried cranberries can be used instead of (or in addition to) chocolate chips.

[^3]: Bake time is closer to 25 minutes for muffins, or 15 minutes for mini muffins. Muffins aren't much use for making french toast, but they're great for snacking and sharing.

## French Toast

- 3 eggs
- 1/3 cup plain yogurt
- Cinnamon to taste
- Butter

In the morning, start some butter in a large skillet over medium heat.

Combine the remaining 3 eggs, yogurt, and cinnamon. Slice the loaf (or whatever's left of it) and dip the slices in the egg mixture, making sure to coat both sides. Fry until golden brown on both sides.

Serves four. Best with fruit, jam, and/or peanut butter.
