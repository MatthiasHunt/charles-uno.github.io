If you live in a metropolitan area, you're probably not far from a local farmers market. These markets are a great, budget-friendly way to get some extra vegetables into your diet, as well as to support your local farmers. Unlike grocery stores, which ship in produce from Mexico, California, and other regions with year-round growing seasons, local farmers markets (typically) source locally. As a result, different kinds of produce are available at different times of year; asparagus grows in the spring, apples in the fall, etc.

Farmers markets can't be beat in terms of freshness; picked-this-morning snap peas are much sweeter and crunchier than the ones you buy at the store. Not only that, but farmers markets often have unusual varieties of vegetable -- purple cauliflower, dragon carrots, ground cherries, etc -- that groceries don't usually carry.

The downside of farmers markets is seasonal variation. Whereas the grocery has tomatoes year-round, the farmers market only has them for a month or two each year.






Seasonally-varying produce selection might sound inconvenient, but with a little bit of work it can be a huge

Stock up on fruits and vegetables at the farmers market.

With good timing, you can get a *lot* for your money. At the end of the season, it's a fire sale on big buckets of tomatoes and peppers.

I particularly like to stock up on ripe (red) jalape√±o peppers. Compared to the green ones, they are sweeter and fruitier. Usually can't find them in the store. Very useful in the winter -- spicy tequila, chili, etc.

Don't worry about cosmetic defects. Freezing breaks the produce down a little bit, so it won't be used for pretty salads. But it'll be great for cooking.

Wash thoroughly, then lay out on the pan. Try not to get excessive water on the pan.

Get rid of stumps, seeds, bruises, whatever. You want to be able to toss it straight into the pan from the freezer. You don't want to thaw out a tomato and *then* try to excise the bruises.

Strawberries -- rinse and remove the stems.

Apples -- quarter and core. Optionally, also remove the skin. It gets a little weird when you freeze it, but if you're just making applesauce or something it won't matter.

Raspberries, currants, etc -- rinse thoroughly, but try not to rupture them. They will freeze better (and come off the pan more cleanly) if they are not covered in juice.

Lay out on a cookie sheet and freeze.

Move from the cookie sheet to a ziplock bag.

Get as much air as you can out of the bag, to minimize freezer burn.

Label the bag! Date and also contents. Bell peppers and hot peppers look a lot alike when they're sliced.

OPTIONALLY, you can roast the vegetables before you freeze them!

For peppers, lay them skin-side-up. Roast until they blacken a little bit. Then put them in a bowl and let them steam for a few minutes. Scrape off the blackened skin with a knife.

For tomatoes, I like to cut them in half and put the skin side down. The top won't really caramelize. Bake until the tomatoes shrink down to about half their normal size. Half an hour to an hour, depending on the tomatoes. The bottoms of the tomatoes should have a nice caramelization. You don't even have to take them off the cookie sheet -- after letting it cool, just throw it right into the freezer.
