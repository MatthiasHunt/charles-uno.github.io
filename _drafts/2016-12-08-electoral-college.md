The outcome of the 2016 presidential election has led to renewed calls to abolish the electoral college. Donald Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote [46% to 48%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016), leaving supporters of Hillary Clinton feeling like they'd been cheated by an archaic technicality.

In a democracy, it's problematic when a large chunk of the population does not feel represented. 




Democracy only works as long as everyone believes that it works. So PV/EV splits are bad.

But let's also talk about why the EV is important in modern-day America.




A sizable, consistent, bipartisan majority of Americans would prefer to see the Electoral College replaced by a national popular vote.

such calls are dangerous

people are not thinking through the consequences

we can do better with a tweak



In Congress, hundreds of attempts




[^1]: Over the past two centuries, there have been [over 700 attempts](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html#changes) by Congress to eliminate the electoral college. A [consistent, bipartisan majority](http://www.gallup.com/poll/150245/americans-swap-electoral-college-popular-vote.aspx) of voters would prefer a national popular vote.





- electoral college exaggerates small differences.
- Electoral college ensures 2 candidates. With a direct election, you could have many candidates, with the winner getting a plurality of 30% or less. You essentially can't directly elect the executive.
- Electoral college prevents state-level shenanigans to manipulate the popular vote. CA could drop its voting age to 15 to rack up the blue margin, for example.
- Electoral college is a defense against interminable litigation. The 2000 election was close; the Florida recount was stuck in the courts for months. Imagine if we had to recount the whole country!

The canonical justification for the Electoral College is to prevent the urban majority from eclipsing rural interests. Urban centers are home to [four out of five](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/ua/uafaq.html) Americans; in principle, a presidential candidate could win the popular vote despite ignoring rural communities. Personally, I do not find this angle to be compelling. There are plenty of other ways to split the country 80-20 -- should we also triple[^2] the vote weight of Latinos, senior citizens, or the [religiously unaffiliated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States)?




[^2]: Wyoming has 3 electoral votes and a population of 600k, which averages out to 5.1 EV per million people. California has 55 electoral votes and a population of 38M, which is 1.4 EV per million. In hand-wavey terms, that means a voter in Wyoming has more than triple the power of a voter in California.
