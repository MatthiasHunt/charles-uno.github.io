Not everyone is good with numbers, and that's OK.


important for number people to be good at communicating







Polling average from [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dnc-tried-to-avoid-a-lopsided-debate-it-got-one-anyway/)

Words spoken from [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-first-democratic-debate-in-five-charts/)

Difference between 1%, 5%, and 10% is very significant. 18/20 candidates are below 10% in the polling average, but they're all squished into the left third of the plot!

> And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the number of words spoken by each of the candidates roughly correlated with their polling averages over both nights, with the correlation being somewhat stronger during the second debate.

> But there were notable outliers, like Booker and Harris, who both spoke more than their polling averages might have predicted. Sanders and Warren were also outliers, in that they spoke less than their standing in the polls might have suggested. And then, of course, thereâ€™s Andrew Yang, who spoke the least out of all the candidates even though he was in the middle of the pack in polling average.


In their plot, it's not at all clear that Yang is in the "middle of the pack." But on a log scale, he's a clear outlier.
