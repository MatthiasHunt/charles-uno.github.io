In Amonkhet draft, the fastest decks are wildly aggressive. Slower decks have access to powerful synergies -- embalm, 
-1/-1 counters, and trial/cartouche shenanigans all offer viable lategame plans that don't rely on opening a bomb rare. The unusually-broad format, combined with the return of cycling, has prompted many to move away from the 17-land conventional wisdom for a draft deck. There are [rumblings](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/how-to-draft-gb-counters-in-amonkhet/) of people running land counts as low as 14. 

Fewer lands means more spells, and it's spells that win games. We all know the frustration of watching a game slip away while topdecking land after land after land. Ideally, we want our decks to include just enough lands to cast our important spells on curve -- but "just enough" is difficult to judge in practice. 

A 15-land deck will see an average of 3.75 lands by its third draw step; for a 17-land deck, the number is 4.25. That difference adds up over time, but in the short term it's hard to distinguish between deck problems and bad luck.

Before dealing out hundreds of sample hands to get a feel for each configuration, let's crunch a few numbers.

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

... cycling effect is significant, but not huge

And it bears noting that the above numbers gloss over a few issues with dumping lands for cyclers. 

Cyclers make mulligan decisions harder. Swapping out a land for a Desert Cerodon may seem safe... but even in a deck full of two drops, a one-land hand with a Cerodon is a risky keep. 

In terms of hitting its first 3 land drops, a 15-land deck with 6 cyclers is about on par with a 17-land deck... but that doesn't mean they're equally likely to curve one-drop into two-drop into three-drop. The bump up from X% (15 lands, no cyclers) to Y% (15 lands, 6 cyclers) means that in Z% of games, the deck will have to cycle at least one card to make its land drops -- potentially disrupting its curve.
