Splash some oil in a heavy-bottomed pan and crank the heat. Sprinkle the top of your roast generously with salt and pepper and pat to adhere. Cook the roast, salt-side-down, until it forms a nice crust. Repeat on the other side, then turn off the burner and set the roast aside.

While the pan is still warm, pour in the balsamic vinegar and use a wooden spoon to loosen any salt, pepper, and fat from the pan. That all goes in the slow cooker.

Add the onions, garlic, and thyme to the bottom of the slow cooker. Then the roast. Then the other vegetables. Order matters -- if you put the roast on top, it'll dry out!

Turn the crock pot to high and let it go for about three hours. Check on it ever so often with a fork. The potatoes should get quite soft, but the carrots should still have some firmness to them.

Once done, scoop out the vegetables into a large bowl or baking dish. Then carefully remove and slice the roast. It will be very tender, and might try to fall apart when you handle it. The onions, garlic, and juices will all dissolve into a gravy in the bottom of the crock. Pour them over the meat and veggies (removing the thyme sprigs).

Serves six.
