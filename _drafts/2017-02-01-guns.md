The NRA likes to claim, "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." It's complete malarkey: fewer than 1% of gun deaths in the US are justifiable homicides, and fewer than 1% of crimes are stopped by a law-abiding citizen with a gun.

Most firearm deaths have nothing to do with "bad guys." Of the 32k yearly gun deaths in this country, 20k are suicides. State-by-state, suicide rate corresponds strongly with gun ownership. Suicide is an impulsive act, and a nearby gun (unlike pills, etc) makes that act nearly certain to succeed.

Furthermore, of the 12k yearly gun homicides, 75% involve a killer who already knows the victim. Guns are used to escalate arguments and threaten intimates far more often than they are used to perpetrate random acts of crime or violence.

Children pay the price for America's obsession with guns. On average in the US, seven children are fatally shot (and another 20 are nonfatally shot) per day. The US makes up 25% of the population of the developed world, but accounts for 75% of children murdered with guns.

John -- Most firearm deaths have nothing to do with drug cartels or gang bangers. Of the 32k yearly gun deaths, 20k are suicides. State-by-state, suicide rate corresponds strongly with gun ownership. Suicide is an impulsive act, and (unlike pills, etc) a nearby gun makes that act nearly certain to succeed.

Furthermore, of the 12k yearly gun homicides, only 25% (3k) involved a killer who did not already know the victim. Guns are used to escalate arguments and threaten intimates far more often than they are used to perpetrate random acts of crime or violence.

Guns seem like an effective tool for protection and crime deterrence, and it's easy to come up with anecdotes about lives saved by them. But the numbers are pretty clear: places with lots of guns -- legal or not -- are also places with lots of gun deaths.

Scott -- See page 8 of the VPC report linked above. In 0.8% of violent crimes, and 0.1% of property crimes, the victim respond by threatening or attacking with a firearm. The data comes from the FBI's yearly violent crime report.

You could make an argument that a culture of gun ownership deters crime. That may hold some truth: compared to the US, the UK has few guns, and significantly more petty crime. The tradeoff is, muggers in the UK are mostly unarmed, and our gun homicide rate is **quadruple** theirs.
