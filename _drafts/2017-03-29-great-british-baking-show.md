After watching the first episode of the Great British Baking Show, you might think you have a pretty good sense of who the best and worst bakers are.

In the first technical challenge of Series 5 (Season 1[^1]), Martha picks her almonds one-by-one. Her attention to detail pays off, and she ends up near the top. Meanwhile Norman works "by feel," rather than using the electric mixer, but his instincts are poor, and he ends up near the bottom.

[^1]: Season 1 of the Great British Baking *Show* on Netflix is Series 5 of the Great British Bake *Off* on the BBC, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off_(series_1)).

The first episode of Series 4 (Season 2) seems to show us that Ruby can't perform under pressure. She breaks into tears after curdling her crème pâtissière, then botches her angel food cake so badly that she has to start over halfway through. The only person who scores worse than her on the technical challenge is Toby, who uses salt instead of sugar.

Interestingly, rank in the first technical challenge shows no particular correlation with how far each baker goes. If we compare first-episode technical rank against the number of episodes survived, all we get is [Rexthor](https://xkcd.com/1725/).

*Data comes from Wikipedia. Series 1 had fewer bakers (and fewer episodes) so it is not included in the sample. Data is plotted at a silght offset from the lattive points to improve legibility.*

The present analysis considers only the technical challenge because that's the only one to be scored numerically. When choosing who to eliminate, Paul and Mary also consider baker performance in the signature and showstopper challenges -- and it's not uncommon for a baker to do well in one bake, then poorly in the next.

But it's surprising (to me at least) that there is *no* correlation between first-episode technical rank and the number of episodes a baker survives. I would naively expect some bakers to be fundamentally better than others -- and for that difference to be apparent from the start. But that's just not the case. At the start of Series 4, the top three technical bakers are Rob, Lucy, and Christine. None of those three make it to the final episode.






This indicates to me that performance in the competition is not based on a baker's intrinsic abilities.

Spoilers ahead.

In the first episode, we see the bakers' innate/prior skill. They don't really know what it'll be like under the tent.

By the time the second episode rolls around, they know what they're in for, and who they're competing against.

Seems fair to say that we're not testing innate baking ability, but ability to bake under pressure.

Rexthor, the Dog Bearer

Note that [Series 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off_(series_1)) is left off because it's not formatted the same. There are fewer episodes, and in the first episode, only the best and worst technical ranks are listed off; those in the middle are not listed.

Data comes from Wikipedia. I have not checked it... though, reading through it, it is consistent with my recollection.

Data points are offset slightly to avoid overlap.

*Caption... and note that the R<sup>2</sup> value doubles if we leave off season 2, which has that bizarre anticorrelation.*
