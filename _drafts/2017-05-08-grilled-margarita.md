I'm a sucker for those Facebook animated recipes. They're mostly junk -- empty carbs wrapped in cheese and chocolate -- but ever so often I stumble upon something novel.

Subtle smoky flavor

next time, also some jalape√±os. 



They're mostly junk -- empty carbs wrapped in cheese and chocolate -- but I can't help watching them.

 -- pulled pork mac n cheese, mosaic sushi, pizza-stuffed pretzel bites.

1. 2 eggs
1. 400ml roasted tomatoes (one small can)
1. roasted bell peppers
1. 10ml (2 t) shakshuka spice blend[^2]
1. 500ml diced onion (4 c, or one large)
1. 50ml feta cheese (3 T)

[^2]: To create the spice blend for shakshuka, mix equal parts black pepper, caraway, cayenne, cumin, paprika, salt, and turmeric. To make enough for just one batch, that's about 1.5ml of each -- it's easier to measure out 5ml of each, enough for 3 batches.
