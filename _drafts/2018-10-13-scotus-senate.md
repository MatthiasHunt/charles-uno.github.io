America's framers created the House of Representatives to give the people a voice in the federal government. Seats in the House are proportional to population, and representatives are elected frequently, to ensure accountability to the electorate. That said, the framers didn't show much confidence in the ability of the House to govern responsibly. Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers [#62](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa62.htm) and [#63](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa63.htm) that such a body would be unstable due to the electorate's "sudden and violent passions."

The Senate was presented as a stabilizing force. Unlike representatives, senators were to be professional politicians, insulated from the electorate by indirect[^20] and infrequent elections. More than one framer considered that the Senate might resemble a hereditary aristocracy. Dickinson suggested that senators be "[distinguished for their rank in life and their weight of property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Senate#cite_note-3)." Madison wrote in Federalist #63 that, because the Senate couldn't enact laws on its own, at least it would not become a *tyrannical* aristocracy. Two centuries later, the Senate still has an aristocratic feel to it; compared to the House, it's is half as diverse and twice as wealthy[^21]. 

[^20]: Senators have been directly elected since the 17th Amendment in 1913. They are still insulated from electorate by six-year terms. In fact, senators now serve [longer](https://www.ifweassume.com/2015/01/how-long-do-senators-actually-serve.html) on average than they did before the 17th Amendment.

[^21]: The Senate is [10% nonwhite](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/24/115th-congress-sets-new-high-for-racial-ethnic-diversity/), compared to 22% for the House and [38%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States) for the US overall. The median senator's net worth is [about $1M](https://www.rollcall.com/news/hawkings/congress-richer-ever-mostly-top), compared to $400k for the median representative in the House.

As a stable body of professional politicians, the Senate is well-equipped to navigate conflicts between states, or ratify international treaties. These roles were laid out by America's framers. By the same token, the Senate is uniquely unsuited to the consideration of civil rights. When judging the complaints of the powerless against the abuses of the powerful, a body of aristocrats cannot be impartial. The Senate's track record on civil rights is predictably appaling:

- During Jim Crow, local authorities would often turn a blind eye to the lynching of African Americans. The House passed a [bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyer_Anti-Lynching_Bill) to make lynching a federal crime, but it was killed in the Senate. 
- In 1946, the House passed a bill abolishing the poll tax for federal elections. It was [halted in the Senate](https://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal46-1411331). Poll taxes continued to disenfranchise poor (especially Black) voters in the South until the [24th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) eighteen years later.
- Sen Thurmond spoke for over 24 hours straight to filibuster the [Civil Rights Act of 1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957). This is the longest filibuster in US history.
- The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits racial segregation in schools, education, and voting, was filibustered for two months in the Senate. The filibuster was ultimately broken by weakening the bill. 

In the framers' time, the courts were not a vehicle of civil rights. Slavery was a divisive issue, but it was addressed through the lens of states rights rather than individual rights[^22]. 

...





The [Reconstruction Amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Amendments) following the Civil War turned that paradigm on its head. They established the federal government's constitutional responsibility to ensure the rights of its citizens, even if their state would rather see them disenfranchised. 






...


[^22]: See, for example, the [Missouri Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Compromise) os 1820 and the [Kansas-Nebraska Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansasâ€“Nebraska_Act) of 1854. 




was passed in 1854 to soothe the tensions between slave states and free states. 

The first big change was Marbury v Madison (1803), which laid out federal courts' ability to strike down unconstitutional executive orders and acts of Congress. Then, the Civil War and reconstruction amendments established the responsibility of the federal government to secure the civil rights of Americans, even if their state would rather see them disenfranchised. By the end of the 19th Century, the SCOTUS had become deeply involved in civil rights 






- [Civil Rights Act of 1875](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1875) -- SCOTUS struck it down
- "such an institution may be sometimes necessary as a defense to the people against their own temporary errors and delusions" [Federalist #63](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa63.htm)

The following are generally agreed to be the worst SCOTUS[^1] decisions of all time:

- In [Dred Scott v Sandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford) (1857), SCOTUS voted 7-2 that persons of African descent cannot be US citizens, and thus have no standing to sue in federal court. This decision disenfranchised the [half-million](https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/free-blacks-1619-1860) free Blacks living in the US at the time.
- In [Plessy v Ferguson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson) (1896), they voted 7-1 to endorse the doctrine of "separate but equal," opening the door to racially segregated housing, schooling, and transportation. Millions of African Americans were adversely affected throughout the 20th Century.
- In [Buck v Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_v._Bell) (1927), SCOTUS voted 8-1 to allow forced sterilization of the "feeble minded" and "promiscuous"[^2]. State laws resulted in the surgical sterilization of [over 60k Americans](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/united-states-once-sterilized-tens-thousands-heres-how-supreme-court-allowed) Americans.
- In [Korematsu v US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korematsu_v._United_States) (1944), SCOTUS voted 6-3 to allow FDR's incarceration of Japanese Americans, including US citizens, for the duration of WWII. Over 100k people were forcibly relocated, robbed of their homes and businesses.

[^1]: SCOTUS: Supreme Court of the United States

[^2]: Not surprisingly, sterilization was disproportionately imposed on persons of color. For more information, look up "Mississippi appendectomy."

In each case, the court erred on the side of the powerful, rather than defending civil rights. This should come as no surprise. SCOTUS justices are confirmed by the Senate, and the purpose of the Senate has always been to represent the interests of the powerful.

America's framers gave the people a voice in the federal government via the directly-elected (and proportional) House of Representatives. But, in the Federalist Papers [#62](https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-62) and [#63](https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-63), Madison shows little faith in the House's ability to govern responsibly. Due to its short terms and direct election by the people, he argues that the government could become unstable due to the electorate's "sudden and violent passions." The Senate is presented as a stabilizing force, insulated from the voters by indirect[^3] and infrequent elections. Senators themselves were to be elite individuals, "[distinguished for their rank in life and their weight of property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Senate#cite_note-3)."




[^3]: Senators have been directly elected since the 17th Amendment in 1913. They are still insulated from electorate by six-year terms. In fact, senators now serve [longer](https://www.ifweassume.com/2015/01/how-long-do-senators-actually-serve.html) on average than they did before the 17th Amendment.

There were concerns at the Constitutional Convention that Senators -- being wealthy, few in number, and insulated from the electorate -- would resemble a hereditary aristocracy. Madison didn't buy it. The Senate couldn't enact laws on its own, he reasoned, so the House and electorate would be effective safeguards against a "tyrannical aristocracy."

Two centuries later, the Senate still represents the elite, not the people. Compared to the House, the Senate is twice as wealthy and half as diverse[^5].

[^5]: The Senate is [10% nonwhite](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/24/115th-congress-sets-new-high-for-racial-ethnic-diversity/), compared to 22% for the House and [38%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States) for the US overall. The median senator's net worth is [about $1M](https://www.rollcall.com/news/hawkings/congress-richer-ever-mostly-top), compared to $400k for the median representative in the House.

> A sketch of how we tie this together:

Two big changes since the Senate was created:

- Civil War, reconstruction amendments, etc have established the federal government's responsibility to guarantee the civil rights of Americans, even if their states would rather see them disenfranchised.
- [Marbury v Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison) establishes judicial review. Courts have the power to strike down unconstitutional executive orders and acts of Congress.

This means the courts have the responsibility to strike down laws that disenfranchise Americans. But the courts are staffed by the Senate. The Senate full of the most enfranchised Americans -- the House would be much better able to represent the interests of the disenfranchised. In fact, throughout history, the Senate has been among the largest obstacles to civil rights.

The Senate represents the elite. It's nonsense to expect the Senate to also staff the judiciary with judges and justices who will defend the civil rights of the disenfranchised *from the abuses of the elite*.

if you give each state equal weight, you get 71% non-hispanic white.

The Senate never offered proportional representation. In 1790, the first census, one third of the population controlled almost two thirds of the Senate[^10]. Since then, it's become a bit worse; [by 2040](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-variedand-globalthreats-confronting-democracy-1511193763), 30% of the US population is expected to control 70% of the Senate. Unsurprisingly, such skewed representation was controversial from the start. At the Constitutional Convention, Hamilton called the Senate "[confessedly unjust](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/debcont.asp)." Madison spoke against it as well, but ultimately endorsed it as a "[lesser evil](https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-62)" -- without such a [compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise), smaller states may have refused to join the union.

[^10]: Two thirds of the population lived in six states. The other third was spread across ten (and so held 20/32 seats in the Senate).

Modern retellings tend to be a bit more poetic. Charles C W Cooke, editor of National Review, [writes](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/senate-hasnt-skewed-supreme-court-to-right/):

> Provided that federal power remains in check, the Senate prevents no state from enacting whichever policies it wishes to within its border; it merely prevents a handful of states from riding roughshod over their smaller counterparts on those few questions that are inherently national. Thus was the republic deliberately arranged.

At face value, Cooke's framing seems reasonable. It sounds a lot like the EU, where each state is largely autonomous, but interstate and international relations are facilitated by the union. But it does beg the question: over the past few centuries, which issues have prompted America's small states to throw their weight around in the Senate?

The answer is damning:

- During Jim Crow, local authorities would often turn a blind eye to the lynching of African Americans. The House passed a [bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyer_Anti-Lynching_Bill) to make lynching a federal crime, but it was filibustered to death in the Senate.
- In 1946, the House passed a bill abolishing the poll tax for federal elections. It was [halted in the Senate](https://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal46-1411331) via filibuster. Poll taxes continued to disenfranchise poor (especially Black) voters in the South until the [24th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), eighteen years later.
- Sen Thurmond spoke for over 24 hours straight to filibuster the [Civil Rights Act of 1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957). This is the longest filibuster in US history.
- Southern senators filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for two months. The filibuster was ultimately broken by weakening the bill.

Senate was disproportionate from the start. It's now a bit worse than it was.

House is supposed to be swingy, since the whole chamber gets reelected every two years. But it's actually been pretty steady. You get extreme behavior when the national vote is very skewed.

Control of the Senate we might expect to be smoother, since it's averaged over three classes. And, indeed, the vote share is much less swingy. But the representation is *more* swingy. From 1956 to 1994, between 44% and 50% of voters voted for a GOP senator. 32 to 54 senators.

*In the House, seat allocation (white) is roughly proportional with two-party[^11] vote share (red/blue), with swings at the extremes[^12]. It's very unusual for a minority of voters to control a majority of seats. In the Senate, seats swing wildly. The majority party in the Senate has been elected by a minority of voters about half the time since 1980.*


[^11]: Disproportionate representation is expected when one party is *much* more popular than the other. For example, if the national popular vote is 60% Republican to 40% Democrat, Democrats will only win districts with a [partisan lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index) of D+20 or more -- and districts like that are rare!

[^12]: Two-party vote share means votes for third-party candidates are ignored.


Notably, southern states could not resist the reconstruction amendments to the US constitution because rebel states were controlled by reconstruction governments from the end of the Civil War until 1877.

[Senate website](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Filibuster_Cloture.htm): "Filibusters were particularly useful to Southern senators who sought to block civil rights legislation"

Federal powers are far more expansive now than they were in the 18th century. Specifically, the federal government has since taken on an important role that the founders did not envision: defense of minority rights. The civil war and its aftermath were an unprecedented consolidation of federal power. Likewise, all civil rights legislation has infringed upon the rights of states to manage their internal affairs (especially elections).

Current Senate is disproportionate way beyond what the founders would have known. In 1790, the first census, the ratio between the biggest state and the smallest was nine-to-one (Virginia 450k, Delaware 50k). They might have expected states to break up. In the 18th century, borders were in flux within the US. Kentucky was formerly a piece of Virginia, and Vermont was split off of NH/NY. Even national borders weren't settled in the 18th century! Modern-day Germany was divided between Prussia, the Habsburgs, and a number of small states. Italy didn't exist yet. The Ottoman Empire covered Turkey and the Balkans.

[Wikipedia Connecticut Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise): "Madison argued that a conspiracy of large states against the small states was unrealistic as the large states were so different from each other."

There is value in a bicameral legislature, to divide representation along more than one axis.

To be a bit silly, imagine a chamber with 26 seats, one for each letter of the alphabet. You vote based on your initial. This would probably serve to elevate minority voices -- for example, Yang and Vang are common named among Asian Americans, but few European names start with those letters.

More practically, consider a chamber in which you vote for a seat based on your profession. There's a seat to represent plumbers, another for teachers, another for firefighters, another for programmers. It's likely that this chamber would offer a significantly different perspective from our existing Congress, which is dominated by lawyers.

In that sense, the Senate is fine -- but as a lower chamber. The lower chamber steers the upper and adds friction. Makes unified control of government more difficult, adds incentive to compromise, facilitates novel solutions. But the US Senate is the upper chamber, unambiguously more powerful than the House (in a parliamentary system, it's traditionally the other way around). SCOTUS is the most visible example, but also cabinet confirmations and the filibuster.

Basically no action on civil rights for a century. A few laws passed during reconstruction, but they were dismantled/undermined by state/local laws. Some were struck down by SCOTUS. Substance took a century. Brown v Board of Education (1954), Civil Rights Act (1964), Voting Rights Act (1965)

The fact that the Senate gives a disproportionate voice to southern whites is likely why important civil rights victories were dispensed by SCOTUS rather than being legislated. Brown v Board of Education, Loving v Virginia.

If we're going to give disproportionate representation to one group, why is it rural whites, who (1) are a big enough voting bloc to look out for themselves, and (2) have shitty priorities, specifically racism
