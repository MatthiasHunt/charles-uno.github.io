The day after Trump was sworn in as president, [Women's March](https://www.womensmarch.com/) protests drew an estimated 3.2M people -- [ten times as many](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-long-march-ahead-for-democrats/) as the Tea Party protests that followed Obama's inauguration in 2009. I attended the march at the Minnesota Capitol, which drew about 100k people, and came away conflicted.

The march in DC [outnumbered](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/22/us/politics/womens-march-trump-crowd-estimates.html) the inauguration crowds the day before[^1].

[^1]: Comparing crowds in DC isn't quite fair, as Trump faces a home field disadvantage; he earned [only 4%](http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/district-of-columbia) of the vote there.

At the march/rally, I was impressed with the speakers, but frustrated with many of the signs. I don't want to be part of a Tea Party movement on the left, fixated on opposition to the President. I'm concerned that we'll see a rise of insurgent hard-liners in Democratic primaries. 

Ideological purity tests are how you build a small tent full of extremists -- who obstruct when they're in the minority and steamroll when they're in the majority. 

I'd much rather have a big tent centered around broad, forward-looking goals: healthcare access, racial justice, livable wages, etc. If that means supporting pro-gun progressives in SD, or pro-pharma progressives in NJ, so be it. I don't need to agree with everyone about everything. 

The strength of a coalition comes from its size, not its homogeneity.

If opposition to Trump is (or appears) partisan, Trump wins in Congress. Rep Lewis's all-Democrat inauguration boycott presents the appearance of a unified GOP. 

To erode Trump's 46%, it's important to showcase dissent within the GOP.

If the Women's March was a rally for the Democratic Party, organizers were wrong to kick pro-life groups to the curb. Pro-life Democrats exist, and they deserve a spot under the tent. (If the DNC only supported across-the-board progressives, it would be unable to compete for Senate seats in conservative states.)

On the other hand, if the Women's March was about rallying support for reproductive rights, including the right to abortion, the prominent inclusion of pro-life groups would muddle the message. Recall Occupy Wall Street: protests can't be powerful unless they're coherent.

The official website frames the march in terms of issues, not partisanship, and lists "open access to safe, legal, affordable abortion and birth control" as a core principle.

But that framing should perhaps be taken with a grain of salt -- the event's headliners were Democratic officials, 80% of its participation was in Obama/Clinton states, and









Sen Booker says "This is not a Democrat or Republican thing. This is actually something we can all unify around."
