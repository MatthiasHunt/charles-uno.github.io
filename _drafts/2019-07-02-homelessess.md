Under no circumstances should a child in America[^1] be homeless. I believe strongly that the government (whether federal, state, or local) should ensure that every child in the country has a safe place to sleep

-- even if doing so is expensive






[^1]: Child homelessness *anywhere* is morally appalling, but let's start with the problems we can readily solve. 









In some states, we could end homelessness *today*. There are more empty homes than there are people without homes. A few years ago, Utah did just that. They gave each person experiencing homelessness a roof and set them up with a social worker to get them back on their feet. The results were staggering.

Not only that, but it didn't cost them anything! The cost of the apartments and social workers was offset by fewer police calls, jail stays, and emergency room visits. 

Homelessness has long-term economic costs too. Children without a safe place to sleep can't perform at school. 

Homeless youth are at high risk for sexual assault, or even being conscripted into sex work.
