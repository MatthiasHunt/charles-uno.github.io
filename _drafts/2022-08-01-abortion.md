Imagine the government showing up at your door and asking for one of your kidneys.
They tell you that your kidney will save a child's life.
Due to genetic factors, you're the only possible donor.
Also, if you refuse, you'll go to prison.

I hope we can agree that this situation would be outrageous.
Donating a kidney is pretty safe[^1], but that's not really the point.
It's about bodily autonomy.
Using coercive power to take control of someone else's body is the stuff of nightmares.

[^1]: The mortality rate for kidney donors is about 1 in 5000, though [estimates][kidney_mortality_1] [vary][kidney_mortality_2]. Donors are advised to avoid strenuous physical activity for [a month or two][donor_recovery] after the operation. Life expectancy is [not adversely affected][kidney_life_expectancy].

And yet, abortion restrictions are just that.
By preventing a woman from terminating her pregnancy, the government is hijacking her bodily functions for the benefit of the fetus.
It doesn't matter that carrying a pregnancy to term is pretty safe[^2].
It doesn't matter if you believe the fetus is a person.
Just as the government is not entitled to your kidney to save a life, neither is it entitled to a woman's womb.

[^2]: The mortality rate for carrying a pregnancy to term (including delivery) is about [1 in 5000][pregnancy_mortality]. But even a healthy pregnancy can be physically harrowing: nausea, weight gain, reduced mobility, [joint loosening][joint_loosening], and so on. Pregnancy also increases the woman's long-term risk for [several adverse conditions][pregnancy_long_term_effects].

Prior to viability ([about 24 weeks][fetal_viability]), the implications are clear: the government has no business interfering with a woman's decisions about her own body.

Once the fetus is viable, things get a bit dicey.
You could perhaps argue that a woman has the right to terminate the pregnancy, but also an obligation to deliver the fetus into medical care.

The point is largely moot. Only about 1% of abortions happen after 20 weeks.







About 1% of abortions are performed after 21 weeks
[abortion_by_week]: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/ss/ss7009a1.htm#T10_down

Abortions after 21 weeks often are due to fetal abnormalities or maternal health concerns
[late_abortion_reasons]: https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/abortions-later-in-pregnancy/

Mortality rate for abortion is about 1 per 200k
[abortion_mortality]: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/06/24/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the-u-s-2/



The woman's body belongs to the woman, not to the fetus or to the government.



[fetal_viability]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11753511/


Carrying a pregnancy to term means
- reshuffling internal organs
- significant weight gain
- nausea
- reduced mobility
- long term adverse effects



- Even if you believe that the fetus is a person, it has no claim to the woman's body.
- Carrying a pregnancy to term is a bigger ask than donating a kidney. Comparable mortality rate, way more side effects, risk of long-term consequences.












Donating a kidney is invasive and inconvenient, but remarkably safe.
Post-op recovery lasts [about a month][donor_recovery], and after that there are generally no ill effects.
Kidney donors have about the same [life expectancy][kidney_life_expectancy] as the general public, and fatal complications are exceptionally rare (about 1 in 5000).
For the recipient, on the other hand, kidney donation is a matter of life and death.
Dialysis only works for a few years.
[Thousands of Americans die each year][donation_stats] due to a shortage of organ donors.

Despite the relative stakes, organ donation in the USA is [strictly voluntary][donation_requires_consent].
The government cannot force you to donate a kidney under any circumstances --- even if you are the only possible donor, even to save the life of your child, and even if you had [previously agreed][donor_can_change_mind] to donate.
Bodily autonomy is a fundamental human right.
Government organ hijacking is an egregious violation of that right, regardless of any supposed "greater good".

But laws restricting abortion are exactly that.
The government is overruling a woman's bodily autonomy.
It's hijacking her uterus for the benefit of a third party.

It doesn't matter when life "begins"





rape exception - who certifies the rape?

Only [about half of Americans][organ_donor_rate] are registered as organ donors.

In the short term, carrying a pregnancy to term is more serious/disruptive than donating a kidney.
- Restrictive diet
- Weight gain
- Hormonal changes
- Length of recovery (note: c section)

Pregnancy comes with serious long-term consequences too.



Plus: criminalizing abortion comes with barbaric side effects.

A first-trimester fetus can't survive outside the womb.
Terminating the pregnancy dooms the fetus

Terminating a pregnancy dooms the fetus, just as withholding an organ dooms a prospective recipient.

TODO: Estimate of rates before roe v wade

Catholic church tolerates abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy. Fetus grows in the fallopian tube instead of the womb. Dangerous for both -- but there are recorded cases of both surviving birth. Scholarly tradition. They have to admit that biology is complicated.
