Based on an analysis of all legal words in [Wordle][wordle], the [best starting word][soare] is `SOARE`.
Or maybe, using [information theory][crane], it's `CRANE`.
An [economist recommends][slice] `SLICE` if you want to minimize the number of guesses, or `ADEPT` if you want to minimize your odds to fail.
I personally start with `RATIO`, since I get the feeling that the author avoids[^1] the letter `E` to keep things interesting.
All these big-brain takes raise the question: how much does it really matter?

[^1]: The letter `E` appears in far more possible solutions than any other letter. However, four other letters (`I`, `N`, `O`, and `R`) appeared in more Wordles in January 2022. On top of that, there was only a single puzzle (`PERKY`) where `E` was the only vowel, while each other vowel appeared on its own repeatedly (for example, `U` was the only vowel in `WRUNG`, `SLUMP`, and `TRUSS`).

To investigate, I put together a computer simulation of Wordle (source code [here][source]).
The first guess can be specified.
Each subsequent guess is chosen randomly, taking into account all past clues.
Essentially, the computer plays on hard mode[^2] and always goes with the first compatible guess that pops into its head.
By applying that strategy to thousands upon thousands of puzzles, we can get a sense for the importance of a good opening word.

[^2]: On Wordle, hard mode means you must use all yellow and green letters. The computer is actually more strict than that. It always uses green letters in that same place, always uses yellow letters in a different place, and never uses gray letters again. From an informal survey, many players seem to follow these same strict constraints.

*My code can generate and solve about a thousand random Wordle puzzles per minute on my laptop. And, because it uses the solutions list, it's pretty good about sticking to "real" words.*

Before we get into the results, a quick disclaimer.
Wordle has two word lists.
There's a list of possible solutions (2,300 words) and a list of allowed guesses (12,900 words).
The vast majority of "real" words are in the solutions list, while the [non-solution words][non_solutions] are mostly nonsense like `KYLIX` and `UMIAQ`.
In the interest of imitating human play patterns, the model only uses the solutions list.
The list of allowed guesses is ignored.

I ran each of the starting words from above through 40,000 simulated puzzles.
Then I did the same with a variety of other starting words for comparison: `ADIEU` (lots of vowels), `LYMPH` (no vowels), `GEESE` (duplicate vowels), `JERKY` (uncommon consonants), `FLUFF` (duplicate consonants), `MOIST` (funny), and `XYLYL` (possibly the [worst starting word][soare]).
Results are shown in the table below:

| First Guess | Win Rate (±0.5%) | Average Guesses (±0.02) |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-----------------------:|
| `ADEPT`     |         98.8%    |            3.92         |
| `ADIEU`     |         97.4%    |            4.02         |
| `CRANE`     |         98.5%    |            3.82         |
| `FLUFF`     |         97.4%    |            4.39         |
| `GEESE`     |         97.6%    |            4.21         |
| `JERKY`     |         96.9%    |            4.25         |
| `LYMPH`     |         98.8%    |            4.10         |
| `MOIST`     |         98.7%    |            3.92         |
| `RATIO`     |         98.0%    |            3.91         |
| `SLICE`     |         98.8%    |            3.84         |
| `SOARE`     |         97.9%    |            3.88         |
| `XYLYL`     |         95.7%    |            4.50         |

<p class='table-caption'>The first column shows the starting word. The second shows the success rate for solving a puzzle with that starting word on hard mode. The third shows the average number of guesses required for successful solutions.</p>

Our values for win rate have a statistical uncertainty of 0.5% in the table above.
That means that `ADEPT`, `CRANE`, `LYMPH`, `MOIST`, and `SLICE` are essentially tied for the top spot, while the rest are detectably worse.
But keep in mind, these precise numbers come from averaging over century's worth of puzzles for each word.
Percent-level differences won't be visible week-to-week, or even month-to-month.
Over the course of a year, a 97% win rate will see about[^4] 5-11 losses, compared to 7-13 losses for a 98% win rate.
That's a lot of overlap!

[^4]: When counting independent events, statistical uncertainty goes as the [square root][sqrt_n] of the count. For example, 1,000,000±1,000 (a relative uncertainty of 0.1%), or 100±10 (a relative uncertainty of 10%). You need a lot of data to build a lot of confidence!

The average numbers of guesses for each word show a little more differentiation.
If you start every puzzle with `CRANE` or `SLICE`, you should expect to enter about 27 guesses over the course of a week.
A few steps down, `JERKY` averages 30 guesses per week  while still being a "real" word.
That's a big enough difference (and a big enough sample size) that you would expect it to show up in your stats over the course of a month or two.

![A Year of Wordles](/assets/images/wordle-graphs.png)
*Wordle-style graphs for a handful of starting words. Numbers show the expected range of results from a year of daily puzzles. The words with high win rates also tend to solve puzzles the fastest, but there's plenty of overlap in expected values.*

Regardless of your starting word, you will almost always be able to win a Wordle puzzle on hard mode.
Even `XYLYL`, a contender for the worst first guess, only whiffs about once a month.



Carefully choosing your opening word









In short, you can pick whatever starting word you want in Wordle.
You might win less on average, but the difference is quite small.

Failures are generally bad luck (or brain farts) rather than opening word

lymph has a weird shape, especially compared to ratio
lots of medium-rate consonants
common letters might get stuck in `LIGHT`/`FIGHT`/`SIGHT` or `BRAKE`/`CRANE`/`GRAZE`
