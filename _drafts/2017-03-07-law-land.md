In 1920, the [Eighteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) to the US Constitution prohibited the "manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors." More than a decade later, the [Twenty-First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) ended Prohibition in a single sentence[^1]:

> The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed.

[^1]: The complete text is actually three sentences, but you get the idea.

There's an undeniable appeal to such crisp, concise finality. It cuts straight to the heart of the issue -- no appendix, no jargon, no mandates, no thresholds. Its meaning is immediately clear to lawmakers and laypeople alike.

Today's politicians love to talk about their own one-sentence fixes to high-profile issues. Republicans say they'll [repeal the Affordable Care Act](https://www.tedcruz.org/l/repeal-obamacare/), and appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will [overturn Roe v Wade](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/trump-ill-appoint-supreme-court-justices-to-overturn-roe-v-wade-abortion-case.html). Democrats want to see a [reversal of Citizens United](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/hillary-clinton-citizens-united-225658) and [scrap the Electoral College](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/306121-dem-senator-introducing-bill-to-abolish-electoral-college) in favor of a national popular vote.

In this respect, both sides are wrong. A complete reversal of an earlier policy is impractical, undemocratic, and ultimately a waste of everyone's time.

Prohibition may seem like a bizarre place to start, since it's often thought of as a failure. The truth is a bit more complicated. Prohibition was an imperfect response to a very real problem: the alcoholism epidemic of the early 20th century. And it succeeded in changing many of the destructive cultural norms surrounding alcohol. For most of its existence, prohibition was even popular[^2] -- several states remained dry for decades following the repeal of federal prohibition.

[^2]: America's political landscape changed significantly with the onset of the Great Depression in 1929.

To be clear, there were serious issues with prohibition. It was too strict, and enforcement resources were allocated badly, which allowed black markets (and organized crime) to thrive. But these issues stemmed from the Volstead Act[^3], not the Eighteenth Amendment. Rather than roll back prohibition entirely, Congress could have reformed how it was interpreted and enforced, seeking out a sensible middle ground[^4]. Instead, they chose to undo an imperfect solution, allowing the same problem to [reappear half a century later](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Surveillance100/cirr11.htm#fig1).

[^3]: The Eighteenth Amendment prohibited "intoxicating liquors." A year later, the Volstead Act defined "intoxicating" to be anything above 0.5% alcohol. This was unexpectedly strict -- many had anticipated that prohibition would affect only hard liquor, as had been the case in local jurisdictions. The Volstead Act also laid out how prohibition was to be enforced; the "concurrent power" clause was meant to facilitate cooperation between state and federal law enforcement, but in practice the federal enforcers were left with too much responsibility and too few resources.

[^4]: It's hard to say what the "correct" level of restriction is for alcohol sale and/or consumption. In the 1920s, we erred on the side of too much restriction -- but it's also possible to have too little. There are societal costs associated with alcohol, such as [domestic violence](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/factsheets/ft_intimate.pdf) and [drunk driving](https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html).

- A solution doesn't have to be perfect to make people's lives better.  
- Once you have something in place, repeal-and-replace is very difficult, as Republicans are discovering with Obamacare. It's a political minefield. If you un-solve anything that the previous solution solved, voters will be pissed.




- If there's one thing people hate more than the problems they have right now, it's the problems that they used to have, that they thought they were done worrying about.





There are two reasons to reform rather than repeal-and-replace.

- Un-solving a problem is a political liability. Obamacare preexisting conditions.
- Convergence. Reforming a bill gets you wisdom of the crowd. Repealing, you bounce back and forth between extremes whenever there's unified control of the government.

Wisdom of the crowd is where you average together a bunch of opinions to get a pretty good solution to a hard problem. And let's be real -- these are hard problems.

At its most fundamental level, democracy means finding a bunch of people who disagree with one another, locking them in a room together, and yelling at them about our problems. The results are ugly, because they're not trying to find the perfect solution -- they're trying to kludge together something that can get majority approval. Even an incomplete solution can make a lot of peoples' lives better. There'll be plenty of time later to come back and clean things up.

Democratic reforms aren't perfect or decisive; they're kludgey and incomplete.

If you repeal everything that has problems and try to do it better the next time, you'll be trying forever.

Democracy isn't a system for coming up with the best outcomes -- it's for [preventing the worst](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/01/arts/does-democracy-avert-famine.html).

The original solution wasn't perfect, but it generally solved a problem. If you repeal it, you have to deal with that problem all over again.

Majority finds it to be a net win.

- Getting bipartisan support by watering things down.
- Writing up something rough and letting the courts sort out the details.

No question is ever truly settled, but iterating brings convergence.

It's not about being right, or finding the perfect solution, so much as it is about finding a compromise that everyone can live with.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd

Each is an imperfect solution to a real problem. Even if the solution is unpopular, there are probably parts that are popular -- for example, preexisting conditions in Obamacare. A clean repeal means we have to solve that old problem all over again.

The whole point of democracy is wisdom of the crowd. Start with lots of different interest groups and try to kludge together something that everyone can live with. Sometimes that means one party writes a bill, and the other party gets its say later by reforming it. What *doesn't* get there is "repeal and replace." The Democrats passed a bill along party lines. The debate can never be over until the Republicans have their voices heard. That can mean reforming the bill (good) or repealing and replacing it (bad). If the Republicans repeal and replace Obamacare, what happens when Democrats retake the legislature? Going back and forth is good for nobody. Better to move toward consensus so we can be done with this conversation.

From a practical standpoint, none of these issues are as straightforward as they are made out to be.

Before Citizens United, campaign finance was even messier than it is now. Jan Balan [wrote](http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/09/the-court-after-scalia-campaign-finance-law-wonderland/) on SCOTUSblog

> The current political rallying cry of critics ... is "reverse Citizens United!" This implies that all will be well if only that case is reversed, that there was a reasonable if not idyllic state of campaign finance prior to Citizens United. There was not. The laws struck down in Citizens United were merely the most recent regulatory gimmicks that met an unconstitutional fate, and there are decades of prior cases in the field which created a regulatory regime not contemplated by the original laws.

Some suggestion that the UK may have a [better model](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/12/daily-show-takes-on-the-mercifully-short-relatively-cheap-uk-election/) for campaign finance -- their election seasons are short, and far less money is spent. But the analogy is weak. The United States has 5x the population of the UK, spread over 40x the landmass. Plus, unlike the UK, we elect our executive directly (whereas the Prime Minister is chosen by Parliament).

Obamacare is many interlocking pieces. The preexisting conditions clause is overwhelmingly popular... but it relies on the unpopular individual mandate.

Repeal is tricky because -- per [Matt Lewis](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/25/maybe-on-obamacare-republicans-should-just-punt.html), a consistent critic of Obamacare:

> No matter the fate of the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama already accomplished a huge legacy-guaranteeing paradigm shift: It is now understood that it is the federal governmentâ€™s job to make sure everyone has access to health care insurance.

Slavery!

13th amendment did not abolish slavery in non-rebelling states

13th amendment has an exception -- slavery is still allowed as punishment for a crime.

a century later, the Civil Rights Movement was clearly still dealing with the same baggage.

Electoral college. Democrats want to repeal it. Actually, with the exception of right after the 2000 and 2012 election (where the EC allowed Republican candidates to win the presidency despite losing the EV), a [consistent, bipartisan majority](http://www.gallup.com/poll/150245/americans-swap-electoral-college-popular-vote.aspx) of voters would prefer a national popular vote. Over the past two centuries, there have been [over 700 attempts](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html#changes) by Congress to eliminate the electoral college.

The electoral college is important because 51 small elections are easier than one big election. Removes the incentive for reliably blue states to rack up huge margins by dropping the voting age to 15, etc.

https://fee.org/articles/the-accidental-genius-of-the-electoral-college/

Without the EC, a close election would probably deadlock the country with litigation.

In 2000, Florida was very close. The election results were in limbo for a month before SCOTUS killed the recount.

2000 -- national vote within 0.5%

1968 -- 0.7%

1960 -- 0.2%

1884 -- 0.6%

Super-close elections are not actually that common, so 2000 is probably the only example we need. Imagine if we had to recount the whole country instead of just one state.

It's better to look forward to what can be improved, as opposed to relying on rose-colored memories of how things were.
