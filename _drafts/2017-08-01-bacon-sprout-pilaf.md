- 250mL (1c) chopped bacon
- 1L (4c) halved brussels sprouts
- 1L (4c) cooked brown rice
- 100mL (½c) sliced or slivered almonds
- 100mL (½c) dried cranberries
- black pepper

Cook the bacon in a large skillet, low and slow, to render out as much grease as possible. Once the bacon is cooked, remove it from the pan. Leave the grease. 

Turn the heat up to medium and add the brussels sprouts to the bacon fat. Season with black pepper to taste. Cook, stirring intermittently, until the sprouts brown and soften -- about 15 minutes. 

Return the bacon to the pan, and gently stir in the rice, cranberries, and almonds. (Depending on the size of your skillet, it may be necessary to do this one half at a time.) 

Serves four.
