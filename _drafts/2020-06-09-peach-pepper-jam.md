Honestly, this isn't much of a recipe:

- Buy some pectin.
- Make jam according to the instructions on the box.
- Add a small amount of hot pepper to the fruit before cooking. 








Honestly, this is more a footnote than a recipe: make fruit jam according to the instructions on a box of pectin, but add a small amount of hot pepper. Details may vary based on the brand of pectin you use, but it should look something like:

- <span class="metric">1.5 kg</span><span class="imperial">3 lb</span> fresh peaches
- <span class="metric">1 l</span><span class="imperial">4 c</span> granulated sugar
- Lemon juice
- Pectin
- Hot peppers






Then give jars of it to your family and friends. They'll love it, even if they don't love spicy food.




In terms of ingredients, you'll need:

- Pectin
- Fruit. Peaches are best.
- Lemon juice










But t's always a huge hit, so I figured I would write up my notes.

Fruit. Peaches are best. Get them when they're in season. But cherries work too, and even strawberries turn out pretty good.

Peppers. Vary widely in heat.









- Make jam according to the instructions on your pectin.
- Mix a small amount of hot pepper into the fruit.

But it's always such a hit!

 more a suggestion than a recipe: stir a small amount of hot pepper into your fruit when you make jam, then give it to your family and friends as gifts. They'll love it.




But it's always such a hit that I want to say a bit more about it.




recipe boils down to "add a hot pepper to your fruit when you make jam." But it's such a hit whenever I do it that I want to share

This is not a pepper jelly! It's a fruit jam with a kick.

*Super-hot peppers typically aren't available in grocery stores, at least in Minnesota. You can sometimes find them at the farmer's market, or you can grow your own! These ones are looking sad because they've just been brought inside for the winter, but they'll bounce back in the spring.*

You can [freeze peppers](/farm-freezer)
