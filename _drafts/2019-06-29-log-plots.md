The two graphs below show the same numbers in two different ways. On the right, the axes are linear. The horizontal axis goes from zero to two billion people, with one billion in the middle. The vertical axis goes from zero to twenty million square kilometers, with ten million in the middle. Linear axes are common and intuitive, but in this case the graph looks terrible. Fifteen of the twenty data points are squished into the bottom corner. It's impossible to eyeball any sort of trend.

On the left, the same data is shown on a logarithmic scale.

It's the same idea -- smaller on the left, bigger on the right -- but 



It's the same idea -- smaller on the left, bigger on the right -- but the numbering is based on multiplication instead of division.














It's impossible to eyeball any sort of trend -- and eyeballing trends is the whole reason graphs exist in the first place!



instead of being based on addition, it's based on multiplication








Both plots below show the same data. The one on the right uses a linear scale, meaning that the range from one to two million people takes up the same amount of space as the range from ten to eleven million. Linear scales often make sense, but in this case the plot looks terrible.


Fifteen of our twenty data points are squished into the bottom corner, which makes it impossible to eyeball any sort of trend -- and eyeballing trends is the whole reason graphs exist!


The figure on the right shows the same data using a logarithmic scale (actually a log-log scale)










People are good at eyeballing straight-line trends.

if you're trying to show the relationship between two things, it'll be easiest for your audience to understand if you can make it look linear-ish.





time is generally good for linear plots. a second is a second no matter when it is


money often belongs on a geometric scale. $10k is a lot of money if you're poor and not very much money if you're rich

population goes on a log scale.


want to be able to compare Norway (5 million people) to Canada (37M) to the USA (330M) to China (1.4B) on the same plot







exponential trends presented on a linear scale can give the false impression that that a trend "takes off" after a certain value, because everything up to there is squished against the axis




as the values get bigger, the buckets also get bigger


$40k to $80k is a big jump. $500k to $540k is a much smaller jump








look at *relative* change rather than *absolute* change






Not everyone is good with numbers, and that's OK.


important for number people to be good at communicating



Time is linear.

Distance is often linear

Temperature is linear (until you get into astrophysics anyway)

Money also fits naturally on a log scale. one percent, tenths of one percent

Difference between 1%, 5%, and 10% is very significant. 18/20 candidates are below 10% in the polling average, but they're all squished into the left third of the plot!

> And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the number of words spoken by each of the candidates roughly correlated with their polling averages over both nights, with the correlation being somewhat stronger during the second debate.

> But there were notable outliers, like Booker and Harris, who both spoke more than their polling averages might have predicted. Sanders and Warren were also outliers, in that they spoke less than their standing in the polls might have suggested. And then, of course, thereâ€™s Andrew Yang, who spoke the least out of all the candidates even though he was in the middle of the pack in polling average.


In their plot, it's not at all clear that Yang is in the "middle of the pack." But on a log scale, he's a clear outlier.
