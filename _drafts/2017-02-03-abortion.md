Here's an interesting angle:

Pregnancy is organ donation. It weakens one body to sustain another. The donor accepts all sorts of physical risks and consequences as part of the process.

When engaged in voluntarily, the process is beautiful. But the idea of government-mandated organ donation is appalling, even in the case of a parent donating to their own child.

Catholic church tolerates abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy. Fetus grows in the fallopian tube instead of the womb. Dangerous for both -- but there are recorded cases of both surviving birth.

Scholarly tradition. They have to admit that biology is complicated.

Half of all conceptions are naturally aborted by the body, usually before the woman even knows she's pregnant. Chromosomal issues.
