The first Modern tournament I ever played was a PPTQ. I won it, despite knowing nothing about the format. Then I won the RPTQ. Then, despite a few embarrassing punts, I went 6-4 in the Modern portion of PT RIX. The secret behind my success, honestly, was Valakut. The deck is resilient and redundant, making it incredibly friendly to beginners. All the cards are basically lands. You just keep putting them on the table and eventually your opponent scoops it up. Half the time you don't even have to understand what they're playing!

The downside of "resilient and redundant" is that Valakut can get repetitive. Everything happens at sorcery speed. There are no tricks to dig for, or cantrips to dig with. As I learned the format, I could read my opponents' plays, anticipate their tricks, and guess their sideboard choices. But you wouldn't know it from my plays: ramp spell, ramp spell, ramp spell, Scapeshift.

Don't get me wrong -- resolving Primeval Titan is a rush. Breaching it it even better. I'm not looking to give that up. But when a game goes sideways -- Blood Moon, Surgical Extraction, Leyline of Sanctity -- I want to see more cards, maximize my options, and figure out a way to win anyway.

# The Swaps in Question

# Drawing the Short Straw

# Quick on the Draw

# Luck of the Draw

A decent fraction of the maindeck is untouchable. There's no substitute for the curve toppers: Primeval Titan, Summoner's Pact, Scapeshift, and/or Through the Breach. Search for Tomorrow, Sakura-Tribe Elder, Wooded Foothills, and Stomping Ground are unquestionably the best at what they do. We need a healthy number of basic lands. But there are two plausible swaps:

- Farseek vs Explore
- Cinder Glade vs Sheltered Thicket

Explore sees fringe play, but the conventional wisdom strongly prefers Farseek in both Titan Shift and Titan Breach. Likewise, Cinder Glade is widely played and Sheltered Thicket is an occasional one-of. And it's easy to see why. Farseek is a reliable ramp spell on turn two, while Explore can sometimes whiff. Cinder Glade typically enters the battlefield untapped from turn three onward, while Sheltered Thicket can be an awkward topdeck when we need the sixth mana for a Titan.

But Explore and Sheltered Thicket also say three of the most important words in the game: "draw a card." Early on, drawing a card in Titan Breach can help find Simian Spirit Guide and Through the Breach for an explosive turn-three win. Later on, drawing a card digs us that much closer to a sideboard card or finisher -- especially if our opponent has managed to keep Valakut offline. The question is, if we want the flexibility, how does it affect our speed?
