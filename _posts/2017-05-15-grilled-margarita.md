About a week ahead of time, slice your pepper and drop it into the bottle of tequila to infuse. Taste it daily[^1], and pull the pepper once you're happy with the spice level. The goal isn't to make the tequila *hot* exactly, but to leave a nice tingle on the tongue.

[^1]: Peppers vary widely! Sometimes you'll be done infusing after one day. Other times it'll take the full week.

Halve each citrus. Grill them cut-side-down over high heat until grill lines are clearly visible, about a minute. Allow them to cool, then juice them. Run the juice through a sieve to remove any seeds.

Mix the juice one-to-one with tequila. If it's too sour, add sugar or agave to taste -- and remember to buy fewer lemons next time!

Serve on the rocks. Garnish with grilled jalapeño slices. Makes about a dozen drinks.
