When surveyed, most Americans say they would prefer to spend their final days in the comfort of their own homes. But in practice, [the majority die in hospitals](https://palliative.stanford.edu/home-hospice-home-care-of-the-dying-patient/where-do-americans-die/), surrounded by unfamiliar people and machines. Worse still, many who die in hospitals shouldn't be dying at all. [Over 100k](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/09/20/224507654/how-many-die-from-medical-mistakes-in-u-s-hospitals) American lives are lost each year due to medical errors -- unnecessary surgery, incorrect prescription, etc -- which puts these errors among the 10 most [common causes of death](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) in the US, up there with heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.

Medical errors account for a similar death rate in other wealthy nations -- [Canada](http://globalnews.ca/news/3026275/1-in-18-canadian-hospital-patients-experience-harm-from-preventable-errors-study/), the [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/14/avoidable-deaths-nhs-hospitals-study), [Germany](http://www.upi.com/17000-die-in-Germany-from-medical-errors/52721267847072/) -- and yet, it's unheard-of for doctors to face criminal charges for murder or manslaughter. To be clear, this is a good thing. It should be very difficult for a doctor, doing their job in good faith, to be convicted of a felony.

Doctors are routinely faced with life-and-death decisions; if mistakes opened them up to criminal prosecution, the country would suffer a rash of understaffed hospitals. Thousands of doctors would go to prison. Rural areas, many of which already face [physician shortages](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/01/2016-15678/lists-of-designated-primary-medical-care-mental-health-and-dental-health-professional-shortage-areas), would be hit hardest. The suicide rate among doctors is [double](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/why-do-doctors-commit-suicide.html) that of the population overall; the constant threat of a murder charge would likely push it even higher. And it's hard to imagine America's best and brightest stepping up to fill the vacancies -- if doctors are treated like criminals, veterinary medicine suddenly looks much more appealing.

Plus, practicality aside, it would be problematic to punish an individual doctor for the failure of an institution. Suppose I'm a medical student... but not a great one. I have some misconceptions about how guts are supposed to fit together. But you give me a medical license anyway, hire me as a surgeon, and put a scalpel in my hand. When I inevitably botch an operation, there's blood on your hands as well as mine.

Crucially, shielding doctors from murder charges is only half the story. The other half is ensuring justice for the victims. When a slip of the surgeon's wrist kills or cripples a single parent, perhaps the surgeon isn't a murderer -- but certainly the children have been wronged.

The accepted solution is for victims to take up a [medical malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice_in_the_United_States) lawsuit. This is clearly not ideal. For every dollar paid out for malpractice, [54 cents](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa054479) are spent on administrative expenses. The [cost of malpractice insurance](http://doctorly.org/cost-vs-reward-of-opening-a-medical-private-practice/) can make it difficult for doctors to go into private practice. [Most doctors](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1012370) will be faced with a malpractice suit during their careers, [many of which](https://www.irmi.com/articles/expert-commentary/medical-malpractice-the-high-cost-of-meritless-claims) are frivolous. Despite these flaws, however, the medical malpractice system serves two important functions:

- Compensatory damages are paid to help the family recover.
- Punitive damages are paid as an admission of wrongdoing.

The high cost of malpractice insurance puts providers under [constant pressure to improve and reform](http://m.hartfordbusiness.com/article/20140428/PRINTEDITION/304249935/hospitals-battle-medical-malpractice-costs). Hospital workers are increasingly [trained to avoid errors](http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20151122_Medmal_head_here_in_two_lines_of_36_pt.html), and studies suggest these trainings are [effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27549442). By getting their liabilities under control, hospitals are driving down their insurance premiums[^8] -- and saving lives in the process.

[^8]: Malpractice insurance follows the same principle as home insurance. Old wiring can short out and start fires, so houses with old wiring are expensive to insure. Updating the wiring in a house is costly and inconvenient, but worth it in the long run -- it lowers the cost of insurance, and reduces the risk of catastrophe.

Like doctors, police officers routinely encounter life-and-death decisions. Sometimes they make mistakes, and people die[^1]. Unlike doctors, however, police may find themselves faced with criminal charges as a result. After the death of [Michael Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown), Officer Wilson testified in front of a grand jury; after the death of [Philando Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile), Officer Yanez was tried for manslaughter.

[^1]: It's been noted that police shootings occur in the US [far more often](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries) than in other wealthy countries. That issue, while important, is far too [complicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality_in_the_United_States#Cultural_factors_unique_to_the_United_States) to handle in a footnote. Here, it's sufficient to acknowledge that a significant number of people (about 1k/year) in the US are killed by police.

These trials are sexy -- they drive headlines nationwide. But in terms of serving justice and advancing reforms, a civil "police malpractice" suit may be a better bet.

In the Castile shooting, for example, the [transcript](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/448740/philando-castile-verdict-was-miscarriage-justice) suggests that Officer Yanez panicked. Charging him with manslaughter glosses over the institutional failures that put him in that situation. Who assessed Yanez and decided he was ready for traffic duty? Who gave him a gun and a squad car and sent him out into the night?

A criminal suit against an individual officer doesn't just neglect the systemic problems that lead to killings -- it actually obscures them. The suit creates a false choice between "guilty" and "not guilty," tilted heavily in favor of acquittal[^4]. A [consistent majority](http://www.gallup.com/poll/213869/confidence-police-back-historical-average.aspx) of Americans report a great deal of confidence in the police, and that confidence isn't likely to be shaken when the climactic headline reads, "[Officer who shot Philando Castile found not guilty on all counts](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/16/us/philando-castile-trial-verdict/index.html)."

[^4]: The law entrusts police with the use of deadly force, so it's very difficult to prove that mistakes rise to the level of criminal wrongdoing. Police are [almost never](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/) indicted, and even a [truly damning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Walter_Scott) video may not be enough to get a murder charge to stick.

![In terms of search traffic, the climax of the Philando Castile case was Officer Yanez's acquittal, not the $3M wrongful death settlement.](/assets/images/malpractice-castile-trends-16x9.png)
*In terms of [search traffic](https://g.co/trends/9eJeo), the climax of the Philando Castile case was Officer Yanez's acquittal. The family's $3M wrongful death settlement with the city received comparably little attention.*

A civil suit can make headlines out of the gray area between "guilty" and "not guilty." Imagine, for example, if the culmination of the Philando Castile case hadn't been Officer Yanez's acquittal, but rather the family's [$3M](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/26/us/philando-castile-family-settlement/index.html) wrongful death settlement with the city. The narrative would be flipped inside-out: suddenly it's the police who made mistakes, not Castile, and taxpayer dollars are being spent to clean up the mess[^9].

[^9]: The city of St Anthony released a [statement](http://www.savmn.com/documentcenter/view/568) assuring that the settlement was paid with insurance money, not taxpayer dollars... but the insurance policy is paid for by taxpayers!

[Eric Garner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner)'s death at the hands of the NYPD was settled out of court for $6M. [Tamir Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Tamir_Rice)'s death cost taxpayers another $6M. Police departments have balked at the price of [body cameras](https://apnews.com/f19d7270535f4202b92de1872278330f/some-police-suspend-body-cameras-or-hold-citing-costs) and [de-escalation training](http://www.apmreports.org/story/2017/05/05/police-de-escalation-training); perhaps proponents of reform should make sure taxpayers understand the [cost](http://alphanewsmn.com/how-does-castile-settlement-compare-to-other-cases/) of the status quo. There's no need to draw battle lines between "[law and order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_order_(politics))" and "[systemic racism](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/09/29/the-racial-confidence-gap-in-police-performance/)" -- just like training hospital staff to avoid errors, this is about getting [liabilities](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/for-55-officers-involved-in-fatal-shootings-this-year-it-wasnt-their-first-time/2015/12/22/435cb680-9d04-11e5-a3c5-c77f2cc5a43c_story.html) under control.

NOTE: Are we done here? Conclusion paragraph feels forced. And we didn't really get into polarization, at least not explicitly.

To date, activists' efforts have largely focused on criminal cases against individual police officers. These cases typically end in acquittal, which makes it easy for the public to ignore the need for reform. Pursuing civil "police malpractice" suits instead would allow proponents of reform to sidestep the culture clash, while also drawing momentum from multi-million-dollar legal victories.

**SCRATCH WORK**


http://alphanewsmn.com/how-does-castile-settlement-compare-to-other-cases/

- more exposure may not change the settlement size... but the settlement is already worth publicizing.

Civil cases over wrongful death

- less confrontational/polarizing
- more winnable
- more relevant to taxpayers

- Activists's efforts have largely focused on criminal cases against individual police officers
- These cases are polarizing
- Near-certain acquittal makes it easy for people to ignore the need for reform
- Payouts for wrongful death have largely flown under the radar
- $6M for Tamir Rice
- $6M for Eric Garner
- $3M for Philando Castile
- $1.5M for [Michael Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown#Brown_family_lawsuit)
- "mistakes were made" might be an easier sell than "trusted officer is a murderer"
- Use of taxpayer dollars to pay for mistakes

The reforms are framed

Skip the mushy stuff and focus on the numbers.

These reforms are an investment.

Police killings waste millions of taxpayer dollars.

Perhaps advocates for reform should point out that the status quo is expensive too.

Publicizing civil settlements lets taxpayers know that body cameras aren't about hurt feelings -- they're about reducing liability.




Nobody likes to see their tax dollars wasted

"Police are murderers" is a tough sell. "Police mistakes are wasting your tax dollars" may be a quicker path to consensus -- and

Taxpayers don't have to believe police are murderers to pressure the department to reduce its liability


A criminal suit against an individual officer creates a false choice between *guilty* ("murderer!") and *not guilty* ("he deserved it!").

This framing is tilted in favor of the status quo, because it fails to capture any mistakes that fall short of criminal wrongdoing.

criminal trials are sexy, so victim victories in civil trials have largely flown under the radar

By pursuing a criminal case, victims/activists are choosing to focus the headlines on that
they will almost certainly lose

But that doesn't mean victims are left with nothing.



If there's a criminal trial, that's where the media focus will be.
In criminal trials, officers are almost always acquitted.
When a high-profile trial ends in acquittal, it vindicates those who think nothing is wrong.

By focusing on criminal trials (which almost always end in acquittal), advocates for reform concede all the gray area

A lot of gray area where mistakes were made, but those mistakes fall short of criminal charges.

The officer's near-inevitable acquittal vindicates those who think nothing is wrong -- even if there is something wrong.

Police officers are [almost never](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/) indicted, and even a [damning recording](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/448740/philando-castile-verdict-was-miscarriage-justice) of a fatal encounter may not convince a jury to send an officer to prison.

criminal suit blames individual officer for the failures of an institution

- who decided Yanez was ready? who gave him a gun and a squad car and sent him out into the night?
- calling this officer a murderer oversimplifies what happened
- perhaps that's why it hasn't held up in court

criminal suit creates a false dichotomy between guilty and not guilty

- officers are almost never indicted
- even a damning transcript may not convince a jury to send an officer to prison
- equating police killings with murder is politically polarizing, has had little success in court
- tilted in favor of the status quo / perhaps unwinnable for proponents of reform

criminal suit short-circuits momentum from wrongful death payout

- concedes the gray area where mistakes were made, but they fell short of a crime
- no closure to those who empathize with the victim
- if you have both, the criminal suit dominates headlines
- what final headline is better: "not guilty" or "$3M settlement"?
- $6M payout for Eric Garner, Tamir Rice
- vindicates those who think nothing is wrong

Might a similar system work for police officers?

Like doctors, police officers are routinely faced with life-and-death choices. Sometimes they make mistakes, and people die. The nature of the institution makes it hard to restrict blame to a single officer[^2]. And if we treat police like criminals, our best and brightest will go elsewhere -- a downward spiral of ever-worse policing.

[^2]: In July 2016, Officer Yanez fatally shot [Philando Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile) during a traffic stop. The [transcript](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/448740/philando-castile-verdict-was-miscarriage-justice) of the encounter suggests that Yanez panicked. Why was he on traffic duty? Who decided he was ready, gave him a gun and a squad car, and sent him out into the night?

To those who pursued criminal charges after the killings of [Michael Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown), [Philando Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile), [Jamar Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Jamar_Clark), and others by police, "malpractice" may seem like a steep compromise. But perhaps it's a compromise worth making. Equating police killings with murder is a politically polarizing take, and one that has had little success in court. A civil suit brought against the institution may be an easier sell -- and thus a quicker path to reform.

Police departments have balked at the price of [body cameras](https://apnews.com/f19d7270535f4202b92de1872278330f/some-police-suspend-body-cameras-or-hold-citing-costs) and [de-escalation training](http://www.apmreports.org/story/2017/05/05/police-de-escalation-training), but those costs are small compared to a wrongful death suit. [Eric Garner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner)'s death was settled out of court for $6M; [Tamir Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Tamir_Rice) was another $6M. If police departments are made financially liable for their mistakes, they'll work a lot harder to reduce their [liability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/for-55-officers-involved-in-fatal-shootings-this-year-it-wasnt-their-first-time/2015/12/22/435cb680-9d04-11e5-a3c5-c77f2cc5a43c_story.html).




A police malpractice system wouldn't send individual officers to prison, but it would push reform. After the death of [Eric Garner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner) in 2014, New York City paid a $6M settlement to his family. [Tamir Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Tamir_Rice)'s death was also settled for $6M.

Reducing that liability will become much more pressing if they're forced to take out an insurance policy against it

If that becomes standard, police departments will start carrying malpractice insurance[^3] -- and looking for ways to reduce their liability.

[^3]: At present, liability insurance is sometimes purchased by [individual officers](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-insurance-idUSKCN0WJ2R1).

Police practice includes the use of force, so it makes sense to label misapplication of force as malpractice.

Police officers are [almost never](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/) indicted, and even a [damning recording](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/448740/philando-castile-verdict-was-miscarriage-justice) of a fatal encounter may not convince a jury to send an officer to prison.

- Any ruling in favor of the victim is a moral victory
- Verdicts probably drive reform better than protests. On top of the PR, there's economic pressure to reform. Malpractice insurance is expensive!

Medical doctor is a life-and-death job.

- Emergency response
- High-impact choices
- Frequent use of dangerous tools

http://www.nleomf.org/assets/pdfs/reports/Preliminary-2016-EOY-Officer-Fatalities-Report.pdf

3 officers killed during traffic stops in 2016

Things that you might imagine would be crimes will cost your medical license

https://www.fsbpt.org/Licensees/EthicalConduct/TenEasyWaystoLoseYourLicense.aspx

Put someone into a coma while removing their wisdom teeth

http://www.medicalpracticeinsider.com/best-practices/4-surefire-ways-lose-your-medical-license

Doesn't really make sense to hold police to the same standards as civilians when it comes to use of deadly force. we entrust police, as emergency responders, with deadly force. sometimes it will be misapplied. in the same way, there's a difference in scrutiny between a doctor prescribing narcotics and a drug dealer dispensing the same drugs.

Challenge -- it's hard to punish the police as an institution because they are publicly funded. You can't cut into their profits like you can with a private hospital. Underfunded police departments become predatory; see the DOJ's report on Ferguson. This seems surmountable -- how do countries with public healthcare handle medical malpractice?

Policing is a dangerous job, but not to the extent you might think. Lower mortality rate than truck drivers, fishers, or pilots. Most deaths are car accidents, not homicides.

Not all interactions need to be life-and-death. Police shouldn't be killing people during traffic stops, just like you shouldn't fear for your life when the doctor is treating your sprained ankle.

Maybe the gun should be in the trunk, instead of at the hip.

https://fee.org/articles/by-the-numbers-how-dangerous-is-it-to-be-a-cop/

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/08/22/americas-10-deadliest-jobs-2/#2438ddf3424b

Police officers have a mortality rate of 11 per 100k. That's lower than truck drivers, construction workers, pilots, etc. About half of police deaths are homicides. That's about the same as the murder rate of US cities.

How do nations with government-funded healthcare handle medical malpractice?

https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/why-do-doctors-commit-suicide.html

roughly 1M doctors in the US

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_the_United_States

roughly 1M police officers in the US

https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/7/pdfs/04-1038.pdf

only ~10 doctors per year in the US have job-related deaths
