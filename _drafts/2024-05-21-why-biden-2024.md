description: "They've both done the job. Biden did it better, and it's not close."
tags: politics
---

For the first time in living memory, both[^1] candidates for president of the USA have already held the office. 
This gives us the rare opportunity to make a direct comparison between them. 
Skip the pearl-clutching about Biden's age[^2] or Trump's crimes[^3]. 
Who did the job better?

I believe the answer is Biden, and I don't believe it's close.
His priorities are better.
He is more effective at enacting them.
You can check my work below.

[^1]: Under a parliamentary system, like in the UK, there can be three or more viable political parties. They form coalitions to create a majority government. The Electoral College makes that nearly impossible in the USA. Credible politicians here stick to the two major parties, and third parties are a joke. For example, despite 30+ years of attempts, the Green Party has [never won any election for state or federal office][green_officeholders]. Jill Stein, the Green candidate for president, has a laughably weak résumé: she served one-and-a-half terms on city council. 

[^2]: Biden is older than dirt. Not ideal, obviously, but I think the issue has been overblown. The president's job is mostly shaking hands and signing things. Pretty much everything else gets delegated out. The important thing is the effectiveness of the Biden *administration*. 

[^3]: [Trump was convicted][trump_conviction] of business fraud after leaving office. Not ideal, obviously, but history shows that sometimes a slimeball can be an effective president. Just look at [LBJ][lbj_slimeball] or [Bill Clinton][clinton_slimeball]. Better to judge Trump by the performance of his administration. 


## Economic Policy

Trump's signature piece of legislation was a tax cut for the rich. 
He also loosened environmental regulations and made cuts to entitlement programs. 
Then the economy [crashed][covid_economy].
COVID-19 wasn't Trump's fault, of course, but his mismanagement made it worse.

- Trump signed $3,100 billion in COVID [stimulus][trump_stimulus] [spending][trump_additional_stimulus] to help Americans weather the pandemic. But he also [undercut][trump_covid_mismanagement_analysis] the US pandemic response by downplaying the severity of the virus, contradicting public health officials, elevating conspiracy theories, and discouraging precautions. The COVID death rate under Trump was [very high][trump_covid_mismanagement_impact] compared to other wealthy nations, [especially in pro-Trump areas][covid_death_partisan_gap]. The estimated impact of Trump's pandemic mismanagement is 150,000 preventable American deaths. 
- He signed a [$1,500 billion tax cut][trump_tax_cuts] which [mostly benefited the rich][trump_tax_cuts_analysis]. 
- Trump withdrew the US from the [Paris Climate Agreement][trump_paris_agreement] to mitigate climate change. He also [rolled back Obama-era regulations][repeal_obama_energy_regulations] on polution, fuel efficiency, and toxic chemicals. 
- Trump made it [more difficult to access food stamps][trump_snap_cuts]. As a result, nearly a million low-income Americans lost benefits.
- Trump made several attempts to [sabotage Obamacare][trump_aca_mandate_repeal] such as repealing the individual mandate, defunding the enrollment website, and blocking subsidy payments. The uninsured rate went up for the first time since Obamacare went into effect.

Biden shepherded several large spending packages through Congress, as well as strengthening protections for workers.
Those policies seem to have paid off.
The US experienced a [smoother post-Covid][post_covid_gdp] recovery than other wealthy nations: lower unemployment, slower inflation, and faster GDP growth. 
[Wages are rising][wage_growth], especially for [low-income workers][low_income_wages]. 
Income inequality is [falling][income_inequality_falling]. 

- Biden signed an additional $1,900 billion COVID [stimulus][biden_stimulus_bill], putting the US among the [most generous][g20_stimulus_comparison] nations in terms of pandemic support. 
- He signed a $1,200 billion [bipartisan infrastructure bill][biden_infrastructure_bill] to modernize roads, bridges, broadband, public transit, etc. 
- He signed $500 billion for [clean energy][ira], the largest such investment in history. This spending was offset by an [estimated][ira_cbo] $700 billion in corporate tax hikes and IRS crackdowns on wealthy tax cheats.
- He signed $300 billion [CHIPs Act][biden_chips] to bolster domestic high-tech manufacturing and supply chains.
- Biden's NLRB has made it [easier for workers to organize][nlrb]. Union membership is up, and 2023 was the biggest year for strikes in decades. Biden also [expanded access to overtime pay][biden_overview] for working-class Americans.

<!-- - Biden put [new regulations in place][biden_overview] to combat predatory college loans, hidden fees, and discriminatory lending. -->

## Social Policy

Trump's big issue is immigration, but he had trouble getting Congress and the courts on board. 
The lasting impact of his tenure is the appointment of a conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court after [RBG][rbg]'s death. 

[rbg]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg

- Trump appointed three justices to the US Supreme Court. He promised that they would overturn Roe v Wade. [They did][dobbs]. Women in many states can no longer access abortions, [even in the case of emergencies][emergency_abortion_post_dobbs]. This decision also [explicitly][thomas_overturn_marriage] opened the door to rolling back contraception access and same-sex marriage. 
- Trump faced off with Congress over funding for a border wall, resulting in a [35-day government shutdown][trump_wall_shutdown]. He ultimately got some funding from Congress and redirected additional funding from elsewhere. In total he built [50 miles of new wall][trump_wall_outcome] of the proposed 1,300 miles. 
- Trump implemented a policy of [separating families at the border][family_separation] to deter asylum seekers. Parents were deported or jailed. Thousands of children (including infants) were held in federal custody. A judge later ordered Trump to reunite the families, but doing so took years due to poor recordkeeping.
- He [steeply reduced refugee resettlement][usa_refugees_by_year] while in office, and completely blocked [immigrants][trump_muslim_ban] and [refugees][trump_refugees] from Muslim-majority nations. 
- Trump [banned][trump_transgender_policies] transgender Americans from serving in the military. He also rolled back protections for transgender students, patients, and inmates. 

<!-- - Trump's [Department of Education][trump_education_policy] made it harder for defrauded students to get debt relief, and easier for religious institutions to get public school funding. -->
<!--
- antitrust lawsuits against Facebook and Google: https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/01/18/trump-presidency-administration-biggest-impact-policy-analysis-451479
- blocked 5G equipment from Chinese companies
-->

Biden passed the first federal gun safety law in nearly 30 years. 
He also took a step towards marijuana legalization, codified marriage equality, and forgave student debt for millions of Americans. 

- Biden forgave $100+ billion in [student loans][biden_student_loans] for millions of borrowers. 
- He signed the [Safer Communities Act][biden_gun_control] to improve background checks and red flag rules. The bill also includes $10 billion for school safety, first responders, and crisis intervention programs. 
- He signed the [Respect for Marriage Act][biden_marriage_bill] to establish protections for same-sex and interracial marriages in case the conservative Supreme Court majority follows through on its [threat][thomas_overturn_marriage] to overturn those precedents.
- Biden confirmed [200+ federal judges][biden_judges], many of whom are former public defenders and civil rights lawyers. 
- He [rescheduled marijuana][biden_reschedule_marijuana] from Category I (heroin, LSD) to Category III (ketamine, testosterone). 
<!-- - He added a new federal holiday: [Juneteenth][juneteenth], which celebrates enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation. -->

<!-- - Biden negotiated a [bipartisan immigration reform bill][immigration_bill_2023] to combat drug smuggling and speed up the years-long asylum process. Republicans withdrew support for the bill at Trump's request. -->
<!--
- expanding telemedicine
- contraception available over the counter
-->


## Foreign Policy

Foreign policy during the Trump administration was ham-fisted. 
He made broad use of tariffs, which are generally [ineffective][tariffs_bad_gwb] and [self-destructive][tariffs_bad_economist].
He also frustrated our allies by walking away from multinational agreements. 

[tariffs_usually_bad]: https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2016/09/08/tariffs-do-more-harm-than-good-at-home
[tariffs_bad_gwb]: https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/opportunity-road/rooney-tariffs-rising-prices
[tariffs_bad_economist]: https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/07/31/why-tariffs-are-bad-taxes

- Trump [blocked military aid to Ukraine][trump_ukraine_scandal], then tried to blackmail them into fabricating dirt on his political opponents. He was impeached (though acquitted) for doing so. At Trump's suggestion, Republican legislators also [delayed aid to Ukraine][trump_ukraine_2024] for several months in 2024.
- Trump supported Israel, with no consideration for Palestinian sovereignty. He [withdrew US support][trump_peace_plan] for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. He endorsed further [Israeli settlements][trump_peace_plan] on occupied land. He [halted humanitarian aid][trump_halted_aid] to Palestine. And he officially [recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel][trump_jerusalem][^5]. Each of these actions broke decades of bipartisan precedent. 
- Trump withdrew US support from the multinational [Iran Deal][trump_iran_deal], which had been effective at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. He withdrew US support from the [World Health Organization][trump_who] during the COVID pandemic. He removed the US from the the [UN Human Rights Council][trump_un_hrc] and [UNESCO][trump_unesco]. He [threatened to withdraw the US from NATO][trump_nato], but did not follow through.
- He withdrew the US from [TPP][tpp], a trade deal meant to balance China's influence in the Pacific. He then started a trade war with China and several other countries by imposing a series of [tariffs][trump_tariffs] on imports. Agricultural tariffs hit American producers hard, necessitating a $28 billion bailout. 
- Trump negotiated [updates to NAFTA][trump_nafta], the trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the USA. 

[trump_tariffs]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_tariffs

<!-- - Trump reduced troop levels in [Afghanistan][afghanistan_withdrawal], and negotiated with the Taliban to set a timetable for US withdrawal (which happened under Biden). -->
<!-- - That said, he also succeeded at [normalizing relations][trump_abraham_accords] between Israel and several nearby Arab states.-->
<!-- - Trump met with the dictator of [North Korea][trump_north_korea], the first sitting president to do so. The talks were not productive. >
<!-- - [Trump launched airstrikes against government targets in Syria][trump_syria_airstrike] in 2018, in response to Assad's use of chemical weapons. The strikes were supported by NATO and a handful of other nations. -->

[^5]: The status of Jerusalem is a long-standing obstacle to peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The city is culturally important to both sides. 

Biden's foreign policy was more conventional.
He is a believer in global institutions and US leadership on the world stage.
He also scaled back US military actions overseas. 

- Biden led the international response to [Russia's invasion of Ukraine][biden_ukraine_leadership]. He signed [$175 billion][biden_ukraine_aid] in military and humanitarian aid. He also established [clear guardrails][biden_ukraine_guardrails] to prevent direct conflict between nuclear powers.
- Biden strengthened relationships with [Australia][biden_pacific_australia], [India][biden_pacific_india], [Japan][biden_pacific_japan_korea], [Papua New Guinea][biden_pacific_png], [the Phillipines][biden_pacific_phillipines], and [South Korea][biden_pacific_japan_korea] in order to counter aggressive behavior from China and North Korea. 
- Biden sent support to Israel after the October 2023 terrorist attack and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza[^4]. He also leveraged the close US-Israel relationship to pursue peace. He talked Israel back from the [water siege of Gaza][gaza_water_siege]. He brokered a [week-long ceasefire][gaza_ceasefire_2023] in November 2023, and is [pursuing another][ceasefire_work_2024]. He has repeatedly urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties, even threatening to [withhold arms][rafah_arms]. He built a [temporary port][gaza_port] off Gaza for faster delivery of humanitarian aid. And he's pushing for [Palestinian statehood][palestinian_statehood] as part of a postwar plan.
- [Biden withdrew the last US forces from Afghanistan][afghanistan_withdrawal], ending 20 years of occupation. The withdrawal itself was chaotic. Kabul fell to the Taliban as soon as US forces left. 
- Biden all but ended the US [drone war in Yemen][yemen_drone_war]. There have been 4 strikes under Biden (compared to 100+ under Trump). 


<!-- - Biden launched [airstrikes against Houthi militants in Yemen][biden_houthi_airstrikes] to stop their attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The strikes were supported by NATO and a handful of other nations. Biden issues numerous warnings in a week leading up to the strikes. -->

[^4]: Hamas launches terrorist attacks at Israel (rockets, [suicide bombers][wiki_hamas_suicide_bombers], [sexual violence][hamas_rape]) then hide in the [tunnels under Palestinian cities][hamas_tunnels_not_bunkers]. Israel responds by bombing and [blockading][gaza_blockade] those cities, inevitably radicalizing the next round of militants. Experts have called this the world's [most intractable conflict][most_intractable_conflict]. Last October saw Hamas's largest attack yet: over a thousand Israeli civilians killed in a single day, plus hundreds more taken hostage. Israel responded by invading Gaza to eradicate Hamas once and for all. The civilian toll has been [catastrophic][gaza_casualties]: tens of thousands dead, over a million displaced, infrastructure in ruins. It's a humanitarian crisis.

<!--

We have 10+ million immigrants living in the USA without documentation, with more showing up all the time. 
This issue is trotted out every election season because it sounds scary. 
It's mostly hot air. 
Undocumented immigrants grow the economy by working and spending. 
They [pay more in taxes][immigrants_good_for_economy] than they use in benefits. 
And they have a [lower crime rate][illegal_immigrant_low_crime] than native-born Americans. 
More than anything else, the presence of millions of undocumented immigrants points to a broken immigration system. 

-->


## Election Integrity

In a regular election season, we wouldn't even need to talk about this one. 
In fact, it's horrifying that we do.

- When Trump won the 2020 election, Obama and Biden left office without incident. 
- When Biden won the 2020 election, Trump conspired to overthrow the republic. He called the top election official in Georgia and [pressured him to fabricate votes][ga_sos_call]. He recruited electors in seven states to submit [fraudulent results][trump_fake_electors]. He [incited a mob][jan_6] to storm the capitol and disrupt the certification of his loss. Trump has been impeached and indicted for these actions, and [hundreds of rioters][jan_6_convictions] have been convicted. He still [refuses to accept his loss][trump_rejects_loss].
- Biden then signed [updates to the election process][biden_electoral_reform] to close the loopholes Trump attempted to exploit.


## Summary 

Trump's record paints him as a knee-jerk reactionary. 
He seems less interested in policy outcomes, and more interested in picking fights. 
He struggled to get his priorities through Congress. 
He walked away from America's position of global leadership. 






Biden is an effective center-left leader. 
He shepherded an impressive amount of legislation through Congress, including big investments in infrastructure and green energy. 
He strengthened global alliances. 
He moved the ball forward on core progressive priorities such as student loan debt and labor rights. 
And, perhaps most importantly, he was a steady hand on the wheel.



Trump is a knee-jerk reactionary with a messiah complex.
More interested in picking fights, less interested in policy outcomes. 


Biden is x. Big accomplishments include

Trump prioritized Y. You can tell because

One of these men will be sworn in as POTUS next year. 
Please vote to help ensure it's the better one.
