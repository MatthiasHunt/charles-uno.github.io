More cards have been printed for Amulet Titan in the past eight months than in the previous eight years combined.


WOTC has printed more cards for Amulet Titan in the past eight months than in the previous eight years combined.



Fifty-five of the sixty cards in a typical Amulet Titan list from 2018 were printed before 2010.

Before the ban, the same was true of Amulet Bloom.

With the exception of a few singletons like [[Radiant Fountain]] and [[Walking Ballista]], every card in 2018 Amulet Titan was printed before 2010.

WOTC printed [[Scapeshift]] in 2008, [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut]] in 2009, and [[Primeval Titan]] in 2010. For eight years after that, they walked on eggshells to avoid further enabling land-based combo decks.



Other than the occasional [[Walking Ballista:tutor]] [[Reclamation Sage:target]] or [[Radiant Fountain:utility]] [[Cavern of Souls:land]], [Amulet Titan decks in 2018](https://www.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/articles/how-to-play-modern-amulet-titan-2nd-place-at-grand-prix-hartford/) were built out of cards printed before the existence of Instagram[^1].

[^1]: Instagram was launched in October 2010. Amulet Titan and Titan Shift staples include [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] (first printed in 2004), [[Sakura-Tribe Elder]] (2004), [[Farseek]] (2005), [[Simic Growth Chamber]] (2006), [[Search for Tomorrow]] (2006), [[Summoner's Pact]] (2007), [[Tolaria West]] (2007), [[Vesuva]] (2007), [[Prismatic Omen]] (2008), [[Oracle of Mul Daya]] (2009), [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut]] (2009), [[Amulet of Vigor]] (February 2010), [[Ancient Stirrings]] (April 2010), and so on.

[Design philosophy changed](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/play-design-lessons-learned-2019-11-18) in late 2018. WOTC ramped up the power level of cards printed into Standard-legal sets. Some of the new cards were powerful enough to make the jump to Modern. After eight years of drought, Titan players got [[Arboreal Grazer]], [[Field of the Dead]], [[Once Upon a Time]], [[Castle Garenbrig]], and [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] all in the space of eight months.

Evaluating one new card is easy. Evaluating two new cards at the same time is trickier, since they may interact with one another. For example, [[Castle Garenbrig]] and [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] together are more than the sum of their parts[^2]. If we want to evaluate five new cards at once, with more potentially right around the corner, we're going to need help.

[^2]: On its face, [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] ramps us from three lands to five. That seems a lot worse than [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]], who ramps from three to six. But if one of those lands is [[Castle Garenbrig]], it turns out five is all we need to cast [[Primeval Titan]]. It's also notable that [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove:Dryad]] causes [[Castle Garenbrig:Castle]] to enter the battlefield untapped, even if we don't have any "real" [[Forest:forests]].

## The Model

This is where the computer comes in. My numerical model[^3] can read in a deck list, [goldfish](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Goldfishing) thousands of games, and tell us exactly how fast that list can expect to cast [[Primeval Titan]]. The model doesn't know anything about sequencing or strategy. Instead, it tries all possible combinations of legal plays and keeps whichever one wins fastest. This approach is computationally inefficient, but it's guaranteed to find the fastest way to win, even when faced with nontrivial choices.

[^3]: The code (written in Python) is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/charles-uno/mtg-model). Pull requests welcome!

For example, let's say we cast [[Once Upon a Time]] and see [[Forest]], [[Primeval Titan]], [[Simic Growth Chamber]], and two noncreature spells. An experienced player can generally eyeball the correct choice, but spelling out the decision explicitly for the computer is tedious and error-prone -- a calculation based on whether we already have an untapped land, whether we have a bounce land, how many green sources, whether we have an [[Amulet of Vigor]], whether we have a [[Primeval Titan:Titan]]/[[Summoner's Pact:Pact]], and so on. Instead of all that, the model just makes three copies of the game. The first copy takes [[Forest]], the second takes [[Primeval Titan]], and the third takes [[Simic Growth Chamber]]. If any of the three copies gets [[Primeval Titan:Titan]] on the table by turn three, it's pretty safe to say a human player could have done the same.

The model looks at all legal plays, not just the obvious ones. It knows how to transmute [[Tolaria West]], for example. It knows how to stack triggers with a [[Simic Growth Chamber:bounce land]] and multiple [[Amulet of Vigor:Amulets]]. It even knows how to [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]] for [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] on turn two, then pay for the [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]] on turn three. Basically, it can figure out the same line a human player would, but faster. It takes just a few seconds for my laptop to simulate a hand. Running overnight, it can simulate thousands.

![Example Output](/assets/images/mtg-model-amulet-t3.png)
*Example output from the model. Note that the model thinks it has to sacrifice [[Castle Garenbrig]] to use the ability. This makes some bookkeeping easier under the hood. It has no effect on the outcome, since the simulation ends as soon as we cast our first [[Primeval Titan]].*

The big caveat is shuffling. The computer is programmed to try all possible options to find the one that wins fastest -- including shuffling at just the right time to blind-draw into better cards. Essentially, the computer has superhuman "instincts" about the order of the deck. To suppress non-human play patterns, the order of the deck is locked in as soon as the game begins. There are no mulligans. And any time the computer would search its deck for a card, instead it leaves the deck as-is and creates a new copy of that card out of thin air. This means no deck thinning, which introduces a small[^4] uncertainty.

[^4]: When looking at Valakut decks, about one land is thinned from the deck each turn. If we simulate out to turn five, that comes out to about a 1% systematic uncertainty. Amulet decks don't do much searching in the first few turns of the game, so the effect is even smaller.

## The Questions


For the sake of brevity, we're looking only at Amulet decks, even though the new cards are also relevant to Scapeshift and so-called Simic Titan decks. We're also not getting into the numbers for [[Once Upon a Time]] or [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] -- both cards are so obviously powerful that they saw near-universal adoption as soon as they were available. Instead, we're looking at three questions that remain unresolves (at least according to [decklist aggregators](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/metagame/modern#paper)):

- [[Arboreal Grazer]] vs [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]]. [[Arboreal Grazer:Grazer]] ramps immediately, typically setting up three mana on turn two. On the other hand, [[Sakura-Tribe Scout:Scout]] can be activated multiple times. Which makes us more likely to cast [[Primeval Titan]] on turn three?
- [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] vs [[Ancient Stirrings]] vs [[Explore]]. Before [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]], the deck played [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] alongside either [[Ancient Stirrings]] or [[Explore]]. It's clear that [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove:Dryad]] belongs in the deck -- but what is it replacing?
- [[Castle Garenbrig]] vs [[Gruul Turf:Previous]] [[Gemstone Mine:Lands]]. [[Gemstone Mine]] is untapped on turn one, and taps for any color we need. [[Gruul Turf:Bounce lands]] are half the reason we play [[Amulet of Vigor:Amulet]] in the first place. Are we really coming out ahead if we cut those cards for [[Castle Garenbrig]]?

Simulations make use of the following list:

<div class="deck-wrapper">
    <div class="deck-column">
        4 X<br>
        4 Y<br>
        4 [[Amulet of Vigor]]<br>
        4 [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]]<br>
        4 [[Once Upon a Time]]<br>
        4 [[Primeval Titan]]<br>
        4 [[Summoner's Pact]]<br>
        2 [[Pact of Negation:Other]] [[Engineered Explosives:Stuff]]<br>
    </div>
    <div class="deck-column">
        4 Z<br>
        3 [[Misty Rainforest:Fetches]] and [[Breeding Pool:Shocks]]<br>
        4 [[Forest:Basic]] [[Snow-Covered Forest:Forests]]<br>
        3 [[Selesnya Sanctuary:Off-Color]] [[Golgari Rot Farm:Bounce]] [[Gruul Turf:Lands]]<br>
        6 [[Bojuka Bog:Off-Color]] [[Field of the Dead:Tapped]] [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Lands]]<br>
        4 [[Ghost Quarter:Off-Color]] [[Radiant Fountain:Untapped]] [[Hanweir Battlements:Lands]]<br>
        4 [[Simic Growth Chamber]]<br>
        2 [[Tolaria West]]<br>
    </div>
</div>

Where `X` is [[Arboreal Grazer]] or [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]]; `Y` is [[Ancient Stirrings]], [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]], or [[Explore]]; and `Z` is four [[Castle Garenbrig]] or two [[Gemstone Mine]] and two more [[Selesnya Sanctuary:bounce]] [[Gruul Turf:lands]].

Model focuses on Amulet Titan. Dedicated Valakut decks have more or less fallen off the radar, and so-called Titan Field decks don't seem to have quite found their footing.






[[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]] made the deck better when it took the place of [[Walking Ballista]], but it also made [[Ancient Stirrings]] worse.

[[Castle Garenbrig:Castle]] pushes us to play [[Breeding Pool]] over [[Gemstone Mine]]; now it's hard to splash off-color sideboard cards.

[[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]] took the place of colorless spells like [[Walking Ballista]]; [[Ancient Stirrings]] ended up on the chopping block as a result.

[[Field of the Dead:FOTD]] pushes us to play differently-named bounce lands rather than a set of [[Gruul Turf]].

Between the two, we can no longer reliably splash off-color sideboard cards.

[[Castle Garenbrig]] essentially allows us to cast [[Primeval Titan:Titan]] for 2GGG rather than 4GG, so green sources become more important.

- OUAT displaces Karn/Trinket/Golos/EE/etc. Makes Stirrings worse. Stirrings ultimately gets cut
- Without [[Ancient Stirrings]], the deck is less likely to have [[Amulet of Vigor]]. Makes you want a higher land count to cast Titan the "fair" way.
- Castle displaces some number of bounce lands, making Amulet and Scout worse. Also makes us want to play more Forests. Cut Gemstone Mine for Breeding Pool.
- Field of the Dead and Valakut allow you to shave on Tolaria West
- Off-color bounce lands like [[Boros Garrison]] are awkward since Castle makes Titan cost 2GGG
- Hanweir Battlements doesn't give a power boost or vigilance, but you can pay for it with Valakut
- Castle also ramps by itself, making the double-ramp from Azusa less important. Dryad is almost as good.
- Dryad makes you want to have 3 mana on turn 2, which makes Grazer look better than Scout.
- Valakut lets the deck go over the top without double strike

They've been printing cards so fast, it's tough to know what to do with them.

Inundated with new options. Faster than we can figure out what to do with them.

OUAT was so powerful that we barely noticed Castle Garenbrig.

By the time we found a place for Castle, they'd printed Dryad.

And there's still no consensus on whether Grazer is a suitable replacement for STS!

Bounce lands and Ghost Quarter are from Ravnica (2005). 
STS and Azusa were printed all the way back in Kamigawa (2004) -- the first prereleases I ever went to! 







For the bulk of the Modern era, WOTC hasn't printed new cards for Amulet Titan.

Starting in late 2018, WOTC [dialed up the power level](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/play-design-lessons-learned-2019-11-18) of the cards they printed.

Predictably, some things got banned.

Cards printed in the past year have been off the charts in terms of power level. 

In the past year, WOTC has printed more cards for Amulet Titan than we've ever seen. 
WOTC has printed more cards for Amulet Titan in the past year than they did in the rest of the Modern era combined.

Commentary: the changes are good! Get some of the weird stuff out of there. Shorten turns. Less mana floating, less shuffling, fewer extra land drops to keep track of.

Amulet Titan came into the spotlight when Justin Cohen took second place in PT Fate Reforged (2015), but at that point all the cards were already old.

Other than a bit of turbulence in the Modern format, the past year has been nothing but good news for Amulet Titan players. 

WAR gave us Grazer, the first real competition for STS in fifteen years. M20 printed FOTD, diversifying the threat base at minimal deckbuilding cost. MH1 had FOV, the best answer to Blood Moon we've ever seen. 
ELD printed both OUAT, the best cantrip we've ever seen, as well as Castle Garenbrig, a card tailor-made for Primeval Titan. Most recently, THB gave us Dryad, a knock-off Azusa that dominates the board in combination with Valakut. 
KGC was a short-lived alternate win condition

WOTC banned Faithless Looting and Mox Opal, both long-time format staples.

Cards printed in 2019 were off the charts in terms of power level. 

Hogaak dominated Modern for months, even after the banning of Bridge from Below.

Oko has been banned from every format that doesn't allow dual lands.

WAR saw two cards restricted in Vintage; only two other sets in the Modern era share this dubious honor. Mental Misstep and Gitaxian Probe (NPH), Treasure Cruise and Dig Through Time (KTK)

Of the nine cards currently banned from Pioneer (which goes back to 2014), five were printed in 2019.
Not counting fetch lands. They were excluded to cut down on shuffling, rather than banned for power level.

Arboreal Grazer is the first real competition for Sakura-Tribe Scout since its printing in 2005.
