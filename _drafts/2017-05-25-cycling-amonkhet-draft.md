In Amonkhet draft, the fastest decks are wildly aggressive. Slower decks have access to powerful synergies -- embalm, 
-1/-1 counters, and trial/cartouche shenanigans all offer viable lategame plans that don't rely on opening a bomb rare. The unusually-broad format, combined with the return of cycling, has prompted many to move away from the 17-land conventional wisdom for a draft deck; there are [rumblings](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/how-to-draft-gb-counters-in-amonkhet/) of people running land counts as low as 14. 

Fewer lands means more spells, and it's spells that win games. Every player knows the frustration of watching a game slip away as they topdeck land after land. Ideally, a deck should play just enough lands to cast its important spells on curve. But the "just enough" threshold is difficult to judge in practice. A 15-land deck will see an average of 3.75 lands by its third draw step; for a 17-land deck, that number is 4.25. That difference adds up over time, but in any given game either deck will generally find 3 to 5 lands in its top 10 cards.
