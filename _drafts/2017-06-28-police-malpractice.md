Medical doctor is a life-and-death job. 

- Emergency response
- High-impact choices
- Frequent use of dangerous tools

Sometimes, a doctor messes up and kills someone. 

- What do we do?
- How do we judge a reasonable amount of collateral damage?
- How do we weigh the doctor's intentions -- cruelty vs negligence vs being in over their head?
- Under what circumstances do we punish the doctor personally, rather than (for example) allowing the hospital to absorb the liability?

In general, liability is absorbed by hospitals, not individuals

- Litigation is expensive and inefficient
- It is the responsibility of the institution to make sure its employees are up to their jobs?

We trust doctors with our lives

doctor is a stressful job. high suicide rate.

when a doctor messes up and kills someone, we don't generally lock them up. we file a medical malpractice suit. Liability is generally absorbed by the hospital which pays out:

- Compensatory damages, to help the family recover
- Punitive damages, to incentivize the hospital to correct itself -- and to make clear that what happened was WRONG

Doesn't really make sense to hold police to the same standards as civilians when it comes to use of deadly force. we entrust police, as emergency responders, with deadly force. sometimes it will be misapplied. 

in the same way, there's a difference in scrutiny between a doctor prescribing narcotics and a drug dealer dispensing the same drugs. 

Challenge -- it's hard to punish the police as an institution because they are publicly funded. You can't cut into their profits like you can with a private hospital. Underfunded police departments become predatory; see the DOJ's report on Ferguson. This seems surmountable -- how do countries with public healthcare handle medical malpractice? 

Policing is a dangerous job, but not to the extent you might think. Lower mortality rate than truck drivers, fishers, or pilots. Most deaths are car accidents, not homicides. 

Not all interactions need to be life-and-death. Police shouldn't be killing people during traffic stops, just like you shouldn't fear for your life when the doctor is treating your sprained ankle. 

Maybe the gun should be in the trunk, instead of at the hip.

Police officers have a mortality rate of 11 per 100k. That's lower than truck drivers, construction workers, pilots, etc.

About half of police deaths are homicides. That's about the same as the murder rate of US cities.

Philando Castile verdict (and police shootings in general)
- The job of a police officer involves making life-and-death choices. Sometimes they will mess up, and people will die.
- As much as possible, it would be good to reframe the job so that traffic stops, etc, are NOT viewed as life-and-death. Maybe keep the gun in the trunk.
- When other life-and-death jobs (for example, doctors) mess up and kill people, we don't throw the individual in jail. We file a malpractice lawsuit. The institution typically absorbs the cost -- they probably shouldn't have put an unqualified person in the position to make that mistake.
- Malpractice payouts typically include both compensatory and punitive damages. This seems great -- it carries the important admission that what happened was WRONG.
- But how do you apply this to police? You can't hit their profits, since they're funded by the state. And if you cut their funds, you end up with predatory policing like they talked about in the DOJ Ferguson report.


How do nations with government-funded healthcare handle medical malpractice?

400 doctors commit suicide each year

roughly 1M doctors in the US

roughly 1M police officers in the US

only ~10 doctors per year in the US have job-related deaths
