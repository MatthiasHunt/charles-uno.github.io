We trust doctors with our lives

doctor is a stressful job. high suicide rate. don't recommend their kids go into it. 

sometimes they mess up and people die

when a doctor messes up and kills someone, we don't generally lock them up. we file a medical malpractice suit. Liability is generally absorbed by the hospital which pays out:

- Compensatory damages, to help the family recover
- Punitive damages, to incentivize the hospital to correct itself -- and to make clear that what happened was WRONG

Doesn't really make sense to hold police to the same standards as civilians when it comes to use of deadly force. we entrust police, as emergency responders, with deadly force. sometimes it will be misapplied. 

in the same way, there's a difference in scrutiny between a doctor prescribing narcotics and a drug dealer dispensing the same drugs. 

Challenge -- it's hard to punish the police as an institution because they are publicly funded. You can't cut into their profits like you can with a private hospital. Underfunded police departments become predatory; see the DOJ's report on Ferguson. This seems surmountable -- how do countries with public healthcare handle medical malpractice? 

Policing is a dangerous job, but not to the extent you might think. Lower mortality rate than truck drivers, fishers, or pilots. Most deaths are car accidents, not homicides. 

Not all interactions need to be life-and-death. Police shouldn't be killing people during traffic stops, just like you shouldn't fear for your life when the doctor is treating your sprained ankle. 

Maybe the gun should be in the trunk, instead of at the hip.
