At the Massacre of Cajamarca, Pizarro and a few hundred Spaniards killed thousands of Incas and captured Emperor Atahualpa without suffering a single casualty.
Then they marched on the capital city of Cusco, killing thousands more warriors along the way.
The Incan empire --- which at the time was [more populous than Spain][1500_populations] --- fell shortly thereafter.

[1500_populations]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_1500

The Spanish invasion was so successful, in part, because the conquistadors wore steel armor and rode horses.
They also carried (and were resistant to) deadly diseases such as smallpox.
Written language allowed Pizarro to model his tactics after the victories of Cortés.
And of course, Europe had the political structures to send expeditions around the world in the first place.
In his 1997 bestseller *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, Jared Diamond digs into human history (and pre-history) to explain why all these advantages developed in Eurasia[^2] while humans on other continents developed fewer or none of them.

[^2]: The author uses "Eurasia" to refer jointly to Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The mediterranean coast of Africa is sometimes included as well. These regions have been linked by migration and trade for thousands of years.

Right off the bat, the author addresses the elephant in the room: it's not about race.
The book isn't about comparing different groups of people.
Instead, it's written from the perspective of a biologist studying the human species overall.
According to Diamond, the technological differences in the sixteenth century can be traced back to what neolithic humans on each continent ate.

Following the end of the last ice age (about 13,000 years ago) humans gradually transitioned from hunter-gatherer societies to sedentary societies dependent on domesticated crops and livestock.
Centralized food production allowed rapid population growth, as well as greatly increased population density.
Surplus food (and food storage) freed up resources for specialized roles such as artisans, leaders, scribes, and soldiers.
Livestock provided industrial power, mounts for war, and a vector for new human diseases.

<!--
[^1]: The shift from hunter-gatherer society to sedentary food production was accidental, slow, and hungry. Archeological records suggest that early food producers ate less and died younger than hunter-gatherers.
-->

Wheat and peas were domesticated in the Fertile Crescent about 10,000 years ago.
Corn and beans were domesticated in the Americas about 6,000 years ago.
Pizarro's advantage over Atahualpa comes as no surprise when we realize that technology in Eurasia had a 4,000 year head start.
The "real" question of the book then becomes: why did the rise and spread of food production differ between continents?

![Wheat field](/files/guns-germs-steel/wheat-tomasz-filipek-4x3.png)
<span class="figure-caption">Wheat, barley, peas, and sheep were first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent about 10,000 years ago.</span>

Geography is a big factor.
Eurasia is the largest continent by far.
It also has large and diverse temperate regions, ideal for evolving a variety of wild grasses and legumes.
Wheat, native to the Fertile Crescent, is high in protein and easy to domesticate[^3].
Corn is low in protein and required such extensive domestication that it barely resembles its wild ancestor.
Diamond further argues that hunter-gatherers were deeply familiar with nearby native plants; it's very unlikely that neolithic humans in the Americas overlooked a better grain than corn.

[^3]: Wild wheat stalks shatter when ripe, dropping the kernels on the ground. A single mutation kept the stalks in tact. The mutated wheat is easier to harvest, and therefore more likely to be spread. Barley and peas were domesticated similarly.

Neolithic humans in Eurasia also had access to the best native animals for livestock.
The vast majority of large plant-eating mammals are mean (zebra), panicky (antelope), territorial (deer), slow to mature (elephant), or reluctant to breed in captivity (vicuña[^4]).
Only about a dozen species are well-suited to domestication, and almost all of them (camel, cow, donkey, goat, horse, pig, sheep, and water buffalo) are native to Eurasia[^5].
Llamas and alpacas, native to the Americas, aren't strong enough to carry a rider or pull a plow.
Dogs were available worldwide, but only protein-starved societies ever resorted to eating them.

[^4]: When this book was written, it was believed that llamas and alpacas were domesticated from the same species. More recent analysis suggests instead that the alpaca is descended from the vicuña.

[^5]: It's possible that the [wave of extinctions][extinction] around the end of the ice age was driven by the spread of human hunters. Eurasian animals coevolved with humans, while animals in the Americas were blindsided and quickly hunted to extinction. The author admits this connection is not firmly established.

[extinction]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_extinction

Eurasia's traversability is important too.
A crop native to the Fertile Crescent can grow pretty much anywhere from Spain to India.
In contrast, llamas never left South America in pre-colonial times; they were blocked by the Panama isthmus, a narrow strip of dense rainforest.
California has an ideal climate, but food production was not practiced there due to limited native species and the surrounding desert and mountains.
The [three sisters][three_sisters] were domesticated around 4,000BC but didn't cross the Mexican desert until 900AD.
Not only were the native species in the Americas less favorable for domestication, but those species were also separated from each other by natural barriers, inhibiting the spread of food production and other technologies[^7].

![Bighorn sheep](/files/guns-germs-steel/goat-paxson-woelber-4x3.png)
<span class="figure-caption">North American bighorn sheep have social behaviors that make them ill-suited for domestication. They are closely related to Eurasian sheep, which were domesticated 10,000 years ago.</span>

<!-- Humans in Eurasia had the best access to native crop and livestock species, even though those species started out thousands of miles apart -->

[^7]: Trade based on food production helps propagate other technology as well. For example, neolithic Mesoamericans invented the wheel but only used it for toys. They had no livestock to pull a cart.

[three_sisters]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_(agriculture)

Diamond's argument is mostly built on evidence from the Americas and the western half of Eurasia.
In his last few chapters, he applies the same reasoning to neolithic population movements in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Oceania.
He presents archeological evidence to identify the earliest sites of food production.
He then compares that with population movements using linguistic[^8] and genetic evidence.
The same patterns appear over and over:

- Rice, soy, and pigs were domesticated about 10,000 years ago in what is now China. Food production then spread across Southeast Asia along with the Sino-Tibetan language (ancestor to Burmese, Mandarin, Tibetan, etc). Indigenous hunter-gatherers were mostly assimilated or displaced. Surviving non-Sino-Tibetan languages (such as Hmong, Lao, and Thai) are [geographically fragmented][se_asia_languages] as a result.
- [Bantu][bantu_expansion] food producers in Sub-Saharan Africa spread across the continent from the Sahel, evidenced by the [Niger-Congo language famly][africa_language] (Swahili, Xhosa, Zulu, etc). Bantu farmers had access to iron tools and weapons, which provided a significant advantage over their hunter-gatherer neighbors. However, Bantu crops do not grow well in what is now South Africa. That region remained populated by Khoisan people until the arrival of Eurasian crops during the colonial era.
- Hunter-gatherers living on Pacific islands were displaced by food producers during the [Austronesian expansion][austronesian_expansion] out of Taiwan. Modern Austronesian languages include Malay, Indonesian, and Māori. Indigenous people in New Guinea were not displaced, likely because they developed food production independently.

![Map of modern Hmong-Mien language speakers](/files/guns-germs-steel/hmong-mien-language-map-4x3.png)
<span class="figure-caption">Modern speakers of Hmong-Mien languages are geographically fragmented. This suggests that the language family was once widespread in the region, but that most of the speakers were displaced or assimilated.

<!-- Food producers in the Pacific attained sufficient population density for deadly diseases. -->

[^8]: Most modern speakers of Germanic languages (English, German, Dutch, Yiddish, Afrikaans, etc) live in North America. But the greatest *diversity* of sub-languages is in northwestern Europe. That correctly implies that the language family originated in Europe, and that the spread to America is relatively recent.

Societies throughout history have killed, displaced, and assimilated their neighbors using superior technology and deadly diseases.
These power imbalances have often fallen along racial lines, giving rise to the belief that some races are innately superior to others.
In *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, Jared Diamond rejects that explanation and presents his own: food production.
Neolithic humans in some regions developed food production more easily due to geographical advantages and favorable native species.
Food production led to high population density and surplus resources, which in turn led to technological innovation and political centralization.
The rest is history.

explains European advantages. does not excuse their cruelty

Right off the bat, the author addresses the elephant in the room: it's not about race.
He emphatically rejects the idea that people in Eurasia were innately superior to those in Australia, the Americas, or Sub-Saharan Africa.
Instead, Diamond writes from the perspective of a biologist studying the human species overall.
The emphasis is not on individual people, or even groups, so much as the environments faced by early humans in different regions.

linguistics. did farming spread or did farme*rs* spread. also skeletal structure

similar climates: south africa, mediterranean, california, sw australia

first farmers worked harder, were smaller, died younger than hunter gatherers

shifting from mostly wild food to mostly cultivated took thousands of years

8500bc vs 18500bs. wild game less abundant. wild cereals more abundant due to climate. technology for storage. density high enough to value calories per acre. p112

some areas suitable for food production but HGs never displaced due to geography. CA separated by desert from AZ. south africa with a different climate from tropical bantu crops. australia separated by sea from NG, indonesia. p113

wild almonds are bitter and toxic, but it's just one gene. early humans would find non-bitter ones by accident, interact preferrentially, propagate by accident then intentionally. p118

barley, wheat, peas, lentils, flax, poppies. natural seed dispersal threw seeds on the ground. single gene caused that to fail, making them much easier to harvest. accidental domestication since those are the ones that got propagated. p120

food production, rising density. chicken and egg. p111

table by crop type. cereal, bean, tuber. p126

plowing important for monoculture. p128

some species we failed to domesticate until recently. acorns, strawberries. p129

All staple foods were domesticated thousands of years ago. Some recent fruits and veggies but no grains or beans to build a civilization on. p133

it's not about one species. you need enough domesticatable stuff around that hunter gatherers evolve to become sedentary. wild apples exist in north america, but it's not enough. p134

Mediterranean climate select for human-friendly crops. p136

wheat and barley require minimal domestication, self-pollinate. corn required extensive domestication. p137

comparison of fertile crescent to other mediterranean zones. p139

list of important domesticable plants and animals in the fertile crescent, america (turkey, dog, corn). p142

fertile crescent started domestication after 9000bc, entirely sedentary by 6000bce. mesoamerica started by 3500bc (very uncertain) but no settled villages until 1500bc. p142

evidence that hunter gatherers were very familiar with many useful plant species. p145

modern systematic evaluation of wild grasses. nothing else as good. p146

New Guinea. anatomically modern people have been there 40k years. longer than americas, western europe. plenty of time to become familiar with plants. not very productive wild plants for hunting and gathering, so pressure to switch to food production. but no cereals or beans, minimal game. protein deficiency. also: they readily adopted sweet potatoes when exposed centuries ago. population boom. plenty willing to give good things a chance. p147-150

protein content of rice, wheat, etc. p149

eastern usa also limited by available plants. corn beans squash around 900ad. triggered population boom. p151-2

modern plant breeders got pecans and blueberries, but native americans did not overlook staples. p152

chapter about which animals are suited for domestication. p157

american large animals extinct around 13,000 years ago. p162

disease prevented the spread of horses through more of africa. p164

Same few species of animals were domesticated repeatedly (dna analysis). p166

table of when animals were domesticated. sheep, goats, pigs 10k years ago. cows 9k years ago. p167

Significant modern effort to domesticate other large animals. eland (big african antelope) would be particularly valuable since it's resistant to african diseases. not much success. p168

conditions for domesticatability. p169
- diet. mostly disqualifies carnivores
- growth rate
- difficult to breed in captivity
- nasty disposition. grizzly bear mostly eats plants, 1700 lbs, grows fast. but suicidal to keep. hippos too
- tendency to panic. batter themselves against the cage
- social structure. submissive to a leader, comfortable around others, ok sharing territory

spread of crops and livestock also allowed picking up new things. p177

food production never reached california, despite good climate. also never spread from pacific islands to australia. p178

domestic animals from andes never spread to mesoamerica. p178

crops in america (beans, peppers, squash) were all domesticated repeatedly. asian crops were domesticated once and spread. spread was fast enough to preclude re-domestication. p179

crops all over europe by 7000 years ago. a bit later for the british isles. p181

plants are adapted by latitude. length of day, temperature, rainfall, disease. p184

unclear if food production arose independently in sahel or if it was triggered by arrival of fertile crescent crops. p186

cattle, sheep, goats failed to make it to south africa (mediterranean climate) due to diease near the equator. p186

highland mexico would have matches andes climate, but most crops and animals never made it. corn did eventually. potatoes, llamas, guinea pigs never did. p187

similarly, turkeys and sunflowers would have been good for the andes, but were stuck in eastern usa.

corn adapted for colder temperature reached north america around 900ad. p187

corners of australia could not grow crops from pacific islands. waited for fertile crescent crops to arrive on boats. p188

NS axis also slowed crop spread into malaysia, between pakistan and india. p188

barrier in eurasia. indus valley (summer rainfall to winter rainfall). tibetan plateau. himalayas. overcome 4000 years ago when wheat, horses reached china. p189

big chunks of america are hostile to agriculture. central america, texas. p189

mesoamerican wheel, writing never reached the andes. wheel spread quickly east and west from fertile crescent. p190

societies that traded crops and livestock ended up trading technology also. p190

smallpox, flu, tuberculosis, malaria, plague, measles, cholera originally from animals. p196

explanation of epidemics. p202

epidemic diseases can't develop in hunter-gatherer societies. smallpox will burn out in a population less than about half a million. p203

hunter-gatherers move. farmers have to stay close to their own sewage. p205

food storage attracts rodents. p205

Table of diseases and similar version for animals. p207

Why did Aztecs and Incas not develop epidemic diseases? Minimal trade across long distances maybe a factor. Population centers arose much later. domesticated animals. p213

writing was created independently at least twice, maybe 4+ times. also a map. p218

development of writing system took hundreds or thousands of years. p224

alphabet arose only once. p226

Cherokee writing system by idea diffusion. inventor knew of the idea of writing but was not literate. p229

almost everyone was illiterate. just scribes. few enough to trace their individual handwriting (dozens) p234

purpose of the first writing was to "enslave other humans." bookkeeping by the powerful, propaganda. p235

first writing was carried out by full-time scribes. can't do that unless you have a food surplus to feed them. p236

many societies with food production never gained writing. incas. island empires. subequatorial africa before islam. note: invention of language super rare, mostly needs to spread by traffic. p237

individual geniuses are less important than you think for inventions. p245

invention happens iteratively. first iterations are for fun, since they're not good enough to be useful. p245

talking about why a society might accept or reject new things. p248

WWI launched lots of technology, but war can also set innovation back. p251

different sub-groups vary in receptiveness. the most receptive can gain an advantage. over a large time and area, there will be receptiveness to innovation. p253

technology in general (as shown for writing, food production) is easier to borrow than to reinvent from scratch. trade helps. p255

in the middle of europe, islam got its own inventions, plus inventions from india and china. p256

moving away from an invention can happen in isolation. Japan had lots of guns in 1600, then pretty much got rid of them. but if one country in europe had tried to move away from guns it would have been conquered by its neighbors. p258

metalworking. first, pure gold and copper out of the ground. soft enough to hammer without heat. then ovens for ceramics. then bronze (copper alloy). then iron. p259

VERY NICE. technology compounds on itself. example with the printing press. p259

inventions happen faster with lots of people, lots of competing subgroups. p261

americas chopped up. incas in the andes split off by isthmus of panama. dense forest, never urbanized. aztecs in the mexican highlands were split from north america by north mexico desert. west coast of USA also isolated by desert, mountains

terminology for the size of a society. table. p268

chimps and gorillas live in bands (dozens of individuals, nomadic). most humans did too 11,000 years ago. p270

"chiefdom" -- the chief is externally recognized, has a monopoly on force. p272

bigger societies have numerical advantage. probably also technological advantage. centralized political power is an advantage when moving troops. also nationalism and religion. p283

how do bands become tribes, how do chiefdoms become states? p284

food production is seasonal work, which means you also have seasonal availability for war, building pyramids, etc. p285

as a population becomes large, you have a growing risk of conflict between unrelated people. central authority is better than letting them murder each other. p286

polittical structure is necessary, one way or another, to make choices in a big population. p286

known example of chiefdoms consolidating into a state: cherokee confederacy. similarly, 13 colonies. consolidation of germany in 1871. p289

meltiing of ice sheets about 12k-8k years ago freed up water, raised sea levels. p297

comparing australia and new guinea.
torres strait. easily crossed by canoe. filled in 10k years ago
isolated genetically from south asia, mostly, for 30k+ years
NG has good soil, lots of rain. australia has no mountains or glaciers or volcanoes or rivers. poor soil.
linguistic analysis indicates minimal mixing with asian languages
p302

new guinea did develop food production, but had no good protein source. chickens and pigs eventually from asia. nothing big enough to pull a plow or cart. p306

NG population was about a million, but fragmented by geographical barriers. no writing, central political authority.

australia gad a smaller population than ng. 300k

australia. not much seasonal variation. lots of el nińo. bad for crops. bad native plants in australia. modern science has only given the macadamia. p309

australia was on the path to food production. domesticating or fermenting out the poison from seeds. eel canals. millet. p310

tasmania was originally joined to the mainland. split off when sea levels rose. very small population. technological regression: bone tools. p311

interactions between australia and NG went through small islands. not efficient for transferring technology. also very far from NG highlands to australian highlands. geographic barriers prevent technology from spreading. p317

testing this theory with australia and NG. interesting because of the islands becoming isolated about 10k years ago. can trace the spread and interaction of people via genetics and linguistics. p317

NG was exposed to germs via indonesia. people from western europe got clobbered by NG germs. people from indonesia didn't.

australia better for european crops and livestock.

austronesian expansion map. p341

proto-indo-european. many languages have similar words for sheep, since everyone had sheep 6000 years ago when the languages diverged. but words for gun are different. similarly, we can look at proto-austronesian languages. similar words for boat, bird, pig, dog. but different words for banana, yam, coconut. those foods were encountered after the populations started to spread. p343

austronesian expansion wiped away original indonesians (hunter gatherers) but did not wipe out people in NG (food producers). instead, contact spread crops and mixed genes and languages.

NZ is temperate. like australia. good fit for europeans. pacific islands mostly still populated by pacific islanders. they already had food production when europeans showed up, and so had enough population density to have tropical diseases. p353

hunter gatherers and food producers happily adopted better crops when they showed up. p357

large language groups in eurasia. food producers spread out, displacing hnter-gatherers, then local changes to the language. america has many smaller language families. suggests no sweeping displacement. small groups with sporadic interactions rather than well-connected population centers. p371

Africa. Bantu expansion, Indonesian colonization of madagascar. p377


Australia's temperate zones are small, with a poor selection of native grasses and legumes. Sweet potatoes were domesticated in nearby New Guinea, but do not grow well in Australia.

humans on several continents eat acorns, but domestication efforts have repeatedly failed. trees are slow to grow, bad attributes depending on multiple genes, hard to compete with squirrels planting acorns everywhere

australia, NZ, tasmania:
- Australia, NG, Tasmania were connected until sea levels rose at the end of the ice age.
- Contact with pacific islands well documented. Linguistic and genetic evidence.
- NG domesticated sweet potatoes. no protein source, but enough to get to a million people. enough to develop diseases.
- Australia had nothing worth domesticating. no diseases, no technology
- Tasmania is very small. just as high density allows technology to compound on itself, very low population risks regression. loss of bone tools (?)

china, SE asia
- food domesticated around the same time as the fertile crescent
- pigs. likely source of plague and other diseases
- Can track population spread by looking at linguistics
- as technology spread from china, so did language
- pretty much all modern languages in SE asia come from chinese. writing systems too.
- genetically, small minority groups in SE asia suggest darker skin and curly hair like in indonesia. but those people were displaced as chinese language/technology/crops spread

polynesia
- ancient population waves
- austronesian expansion. wave of people at 40k years ago, then 4k years ago, then 3600 years ago. why was each new wave able to displace the previous people? why did the waves never go the other way?
- skin color. populations in the tropics for half a million years have dark skin. more recent immigrants have light skin
- tracking movement using linguistics. german, dutch, english as an analogy
- pottery, food remnants
