Peach jam is a classic condiment, and a touch of heat makes it unusual without being weird. This stuff is great on a bagel, a cheese plate, or a grilled chicken sandwich. Little jars of homemade jam also make charming gifts!

You'll need, more or less:

- <span class="metric">900 g</span><span class="imperial">4 c</span> peeled[^1] and chopped peaches (about <span class="metric">1.5 kg</span><span class="imperial">3 lbs</span> whole fruit)
- <span class="metric">800-1200 g</span><span class="imperial">4-6 c</span> sugar
- Lemon juice
- 2+ hot peppers, seeds removed
- Canning supplies: jars, lids, tongs, and a large pot for processing

[^1]: The easiest way to peel peaches is to poach them. Boil them for 60 seconds then transfer them to ice water. The skin will slide right off.

Follow the instructions that come with the pectin, but mince the peppers and add them to the fruit before cooking. For example, if you're using Sure-Jell pectin, be sure to follow the [Sure-Jell recipe](https://www.myfoodandfamily.com/recipe/053003/surejell-peach-jam). Mixing and matching between recipes may prevent the jam from thickening properly.

*With super-hot peppers, a little goes a long way.*

When I say hot peppers, I do mean *hot*. A spoonful of jalape√±o doesn't have enough firepower to cut the sweetness, and adding more can interfere with the texture of the jam. Go for a thin-walled pepper like a habanero or bird's eye chile. This is also a perfect excuse to break out some exotic super-hot peppers. You can often find [ghost peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhut_jolokia) at the farmers market, and [Carolina Reapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Reaper) are easily grown in buckets. Make sure you wear gloves when preparing them!
