Combine **150 mL brown sugar** (2/3 c), **75 mL softened butter** (1/3 c, or 2/3 stick), **1 egg**, and **5 mL vanilla** (1 t). Add **4 overripe bananas**[^1]. In a separate bowl, mix **250 mL whole wheat flour** (1 c) with **5 mL salt** (1 t) and **5 mL baking soda** (1 t). Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. The mixture should have about the consistency of mixed-up yogurt; if it's too soupy, you may need to add a bit more flour.

[^1]: Optionally, bananas can be swapped out for 400 mL (14 oz) cooked/canned sweet potato, pumpkin, butternut squash, or similar.

Add **125 mL mini dark chocolate chips**[^2] (1/2 c). Then spoon the batter into a buttered loaf pan[^3] and bake at 190C (375F) until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Allow the loaf to cool, then carefully remove it from the pan. Banana bread can be stored at room temperature for a few days; keep a towel over it to prevent it from going stale.

[^2]: Chopped nuts and dried cranberries can be used instead of (or in addition to) chocolate chips.

[^3]: Bake time is closer to 25 minutes for muffins, or 15 minutes for mini muffins. Muffins aren't much use for making french toast, but they're great for snacking and sharing.

*The ends of the loaf make for unsightly french toast, so you should probably just eat them.*

Slice the loaf (or whatever is left of it) as thin as you can without having it fall apart. Mix **3 eggs**, **75 mL plain yogurt** (1/3 c), and **cinnamon** to taste. Dip each slice in the egg mixture, coating both sides, then fry in a buttered skillet until golden brown.

Banana bread french toast is decadent on its own; syrup is not necessary (though a dribble never hurt anybody). It's best with fresh fruit and/or peanut butter.

*One slice is typical. Two slices is ambitious. Three slices is madness.*
