**THIS IS OLD. NEEDS AN UPDATE. PERHAPS IS PROBLEMATIC.**

When you encounter a group fighting like a cornered animal -- fighting savagely, desperately, or even inhumanly -- it is appropriate to look for what forced then into the corner in the first place. In the case of Palestine (or Hamas), that force is Israel, a military superpower which has spent the past half-century [annexing Palestinian land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement), [responding disproportionately to Palestinian aggression](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/07/11/the-lopsided-death-tolls-in-israel-palestinian-conflicts/), and even [blockading international aid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip#Humanitarian_impact_assessment) to the impoverished Palestinian people.

This is not to say that Palestine is the "good guys"; they have an ongoing history of hateful rhetoric and violence -- in fact, [quite a few countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas#International_designation_of_Hamas) consider Hamas, Palestine's democratically-elected leadership, to be a terrorist organization. There are no "good guys" in this conflict in any satisfying way. There are, however, plenty of noncombatants experiencing poverty, violence, and brainwashing. For their sake, we might consider where international pressure should be applied to ease the bloodshed.

Let's look at Palestine's options. They could continue to lob rockets at Israel. They could appeal to the international community for aid. Failing those, they could quietly disarm. We'll address those three cases in order.

# Violence

I think we can readily agree that this option is terrible. If Palestine's goal is war, they cannot win; Israel's army is modern and well-funded by the American taxpayer. If their goal is protest, they are likewise doomed; the media portrays their terrorism, but not their suffering (at least, this is the case for the American media, which is important for reasons we'll see in a moment). Palestinians have tried violence many times over the past half century, with only negative results: stalled peace talks, civilian casualties, and international condemnation.


# Diplomacy

Palestine has repeatedly implored the United Nations for help. In fact, the UN [persistently](http://www.ifamericansknew.org/stat/un.html#israel) issues resolutions condemning Israel's disproportionate response to Palestinian attacks, calling for the Palestinian humanitarian crisis to be resolved, calling for a stop to the Israeli seizure of Palestinian land, etc. The problem is, the USA has veto power over any real action by the UN, and votes consistently in line with Israel. The USA has vetoed UN acknowledgement of [Palestinian statehood](http://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/campaigns/no-more-us-vetoes-at-the-un). They have vetoed condemnation -- [co-sponsored by over 100 nations](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/world/middleeast/19nations.html) -- of the Israeli settlements. There are dozens more examples of US vetoes; see the [list](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/usvetoes.html) for yourself. As long as the USA stands with Israel -- which is not likely to change, given the media climate -- Palestine will find no meaningful help from the UN.

One option that Palestinian leaders have not (to my knowledge) explored is seeking help from China or Russia. This may well be their best option, though it's terrible for the rest of us. Both Russia and China have a history of tense relations with the USA (see [Russia's action in Ukraine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine) or [China's cyberterrorism](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/president-obama-pressed-chinese-leader-xi-jingping-cybersecurity-article-1.1367419)). Neither Russia nor China officially [lists Hamas as a terrorist organization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas#International_designation_of_Hamas). It's plausible that one of them could be convinced to work with Palestine against Israel (and, by extension, against the USA). A quick perusal of world history, however, shows that [proxy wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war) don't tend to end well.

# Disarmament

[Netanyahu has been quoted](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu) as saying, "The truth is that if Israel were to put down its arms there would be no more Israel. If the Arabs were to put down their arms there would be no more war." This claim is perhaps true, but the resulting peace would have Palestine living, in poverty, under Israel's thumb.

Israel's settlements (which are condemned almost universally by the international community) have been slowly expanding into Palestinian land for decades, even during peacetime. Israeli leadership [opposes a settlement freeze](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_map_for_peace#Sharon.27s_rejection_of_a_settlement_freeze), and [is not willing to give them up as part of a peace plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement#Settlement_expansion). When individual settlements *are* given up during negotiations, those settlers are [relocated in other settlements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza#Pro-withdrawal); the [total number of settlers has always been growing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_map_for_peace#mediaviewer/File:IsraeliSettlementGrowthLineGraph.png).

Israel has control over Palestine's borders, and Israeli walls and checkpoints are found on (ostensibly) Palestinian land. Furthermore, <a href="http://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/control_on_air_space_and_territorial_waters">Israel controls Palestine's airspace and severely restricts Palestinian access to the sea</a>, with obvious economic effects -- your average Palestinian makes [less than $3,000 per year](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=per+capita+GDP+of+palestine). In short, Israel has (and exercises) veto power over Palestine's viability as a state.

# Conclusions

None of the above options look good. None of them even look *acceptable*. We might come to the conclusion, then, that exerting pressure on Palestine is not sufficient to end this conflict. No matter what Palestine does, the issue will not be resolved, because Palestine's actions have very little power behind them.

This is not to say that the solution is simply "put pressure on Israel." Hamas is a terrorist organization, with the stated intention of destroying Israel violently. They're a problem, and external pressures are going to be needed to bring their aggression to heel. The point is that Israel must *also* be pressured -- not necessarily because they are "more" at fault, but because they have more power over the dynamics of the conflict. The power to make it stop lies mostly with them.
