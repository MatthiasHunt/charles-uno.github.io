For the bulk of the 20th century, bipartisan majorities in Congress were churning out landmark domestic reforms left and right: [income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1913), the [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act), [women's suffrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), [Social Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Act), [minimum wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act), the [interstate highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aid_Highway_Act_of_1956) system, [Civil Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964), [Voting Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965), [Medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Amendments_of_1965), and so on. In contrast, the past [five decades](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/polarized-politics-in-congress-began-in-the-1970s-and-has-been-getting-worse-ever-since/) have seen Congress polarized to the point of uselessness. The [ACA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act) is probably the "biggest" piece of legislation within my lifetime; it was passed along party lines, and doesn't hold a candle to the triumphs listed above. What happened to the high-functioning democracy my parents and grandparents grew up with?

Television happened -- then cable, then the 24-hour news cycle, then content aggregators, then social media. Our data consumption has grown exponentially in the past half-century, and it's brought us way too close to the [sausage-making](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/16/AR2005041600154.html) process.

By today's standards, mid-century Americans had little access to their representatives. The internet didn't exist. Television channels [only went up to 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Channel_Receiver_Act). Long-distance phone calls were expensive. This gave parties and politicians a lot of freedom. Presidential candidates were [chosen by party insiders, not primary voters](http://www.museum.tv/eotv/presidential.htm). Senators could meet in smoke-filled rooms to find common ground -- and leverage [pork-barrel spending](http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/12/opinion/zelizer-the-case-for-earmarks/) to move things along. Poor supervision left the government susceptible to [corruption and nepotism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoils_system)... but it also gave elected officials elbow room to do their jobs.

Now, information access is fast. The internet lets us keep track of every word of every promise made on the campaign trail. Obsessive news networks allow us to not only judge our elected officials on the bills they pass, but also on how they do their jobs day-to-day. Today's representatives have little opportunity to negotiate behind closed doors -- attempts to do so are [lambasted by the press](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/04/ttip-tpp-trade-deals-secrecy-greenpeace-leak). The public wants to see everything right away; premature opinions take root; representatives are pressured to take uncompromising stances. In fact, politicians who appear too willing to compromise may find themselves [out of a job](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/jerry-brown-tea-party-threatens-primary-challenger).

> According to our study, while 56% of Americans say they prefer politicians who are willing to compromise, in practice both across-the-board conservatives and across-the-board liberals \[which together comprise [over 60%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/) of the country\] say the end result of compromise should be that their side gets more of what it wants.

We saw this sentiment in the 2010 Republican primaries, where Tea Party candidates displaced establishment Republicans in [eight states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_history_of_the_Tea_Party_movement). The Tea Party faction promised to take a hard line against President Obama's agenda -- regardless of what that agenda might be. We saw the same sentiment again in the 2016 primaries when Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz were runners-up for the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations. Both men are known for taking principled stands -- that is, [refusing to compromise](http://time.com/4250238/bernie-sanders-ted-cruz-partisan-senators/).

There's a trope of blaming bad outcomes on low-information voters. Recent decades have shown that high-information voters cause problems as well, by micromanaging their representatives, and even pressuring them to act in bad faith. The desire to "win" at democracy leads to stunts like [shutting down the government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_2013), refusing to consider [executive appointments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland_Supreme_Court_nomination), and voting repeatedly to [repeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Repeal_efforts) the signature accomplishment of the sitting president.

<!-- EC doesn't transition well into the following point about representative vs direct democracy. -->

<!-- It's [possible, though unlikely](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/could-electoral-college-elect-clinton/), that we could even see a presidential election decided by [faithless electors](https://www.change.org/p/electoral-college-electors-electoral-college-make-hillary-clinton-president-on-december-19). -->

In a sense, the representative nature of our democracy is breaking down, giving way to a direct democracy. The problem is, direct democracy doesn't work. Despite having strong opinions, the public doesn't have the time, interest, coordination, or expertise to run the country.

For example, consider a pair of [2016 San Francisco ballot measures](https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco_City_and_County,_California_ballot_measures), Prop J and Prop K. Prop J, which passed easily, proposed to set aside $150M per year for homelessness; Prop K, a sales tax to raise the necessary funds, was soundly defeated. Similarly, a majority of Americans want to keep the ACA's [preexisting conditions clause](http://kff.org/health-reform/press-release/after-the-election-the-public-remains-sharply-divided-on-future-of-the-affordable-care-act/), but not the individual mandate that [makes it work](http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/issue_briefs/2012/rwjf72098).

As the saying goes, "if you're explaining, you're losing." It's easy to rally support for simple, good-sounding policies. But when it comes to the nuts and bolts of making it work, it's a lot easier to poison a proposal than it is to convince a non-expert of its value.

Public interest in politics skyrockets during presidential campaigns, but data consumption is still dominated by sound bytes. Scandals and gaffes -- regardless of their newsworthiness or even [validity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Vets_and_POWs_for_Truth) -- expand to fill the 24-hour news cycle. All other considerations are eclipsed by a candidate's ability to appear "genuine" on camera. As Doug Muder [wrote during the Democratic primaries](https://weeklysift.com/2016/02/01/undecided-with-8-days-to-go/):

> The way you undo a smear is that you tell a more convincing story about yourself than the one your enemies are telling. You look straight into the camera, straight into America’s living rooms, and say, "You know me. You know what I’m really like."

In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton put forward dozens of detailed [policy proposals](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/), while Donald Trump's plan remained [unclear](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-ideology/). Media outlets [across the political spectrum](http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/09/27/hillary-clinton-endorsement/91198668/) endorsed Clinton over Trump. Her public statements were [more truthful](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/lists/people/comparing-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-truth-o-met/) than his by far. More than any candidate in history, Trump ran on the force of his personality; he held rallies, picked fights on Twitter, and dominated the media coverage. And he won.

If we're surprised that the charismatic candidate beat the policy-focused candidate, we shouldn't be; it's been the case throughout the modern era. Obama's campaigns were built on his powerful oratory skills. GWB ran as the candidate you'd like to [have a beer with](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/post/gops-primary-problem-would-you-want-to-have-a-beer-with-any-of-these-guys/2012/03/01/gIQAg95wkR_blog.html). In the past four decades, 1988 is the only presidential election in which the winner (GHWB) could reasonably be described as "smart but boring" -- and even then his opponent was more so.

Americans have a lot of access to our elected officials. We have a lot of power over them.

Data access is good for X, Y, and Z, but we haven't figured out how to reconcile it with politics.

In fact, in the modern era, it's actually the Democrats who seem to be most reliant in the charisma of their presidential candidates. JFK, Carter, Bill Clinton, and Obama were famously charismatic, and inspired
high voter turnout. The same cannot be said of Mondale, Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry. Perhaps this is because of the breadth of the Democratic voter base -- a personality-focused campaign may help distract from the disparate policy priorities of LGBT voters, young voters, and voters of color[^2].

[^2]: One might naively imagine that people of color and LGBT people, both historically-marginalized groups, would easily find common ground. The reality is more complicated. For example, only [40% of Black Protestants approve of same-sex marriage](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/05/12/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/), compared to nearly 60% of the population overall.
