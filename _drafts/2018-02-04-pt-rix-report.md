Removing the second basic Forest

Tried out Kitchen Finks

Chalice in the main is a hedge against Storm, Lantern, Shadow. Other options for the main are probably Anger of the Gods and Tireless Tracker.

I love Ancient Grudge. Affinity is always a real deck, and even a single Grudge in my opening hand makes it very difficult for them to win a game.

I'm down on Baloth, since Liliana isn't getting played as much recently. Thragtusk's 5 power is relevant against Shadow as well as Eldrazi Tron.

Against midrange and control decks, Ruric Thar is a miscellaneous must-answer threat. It's also basically game over against Lantern. If they cast spells, he punches them; if they don't, Ensnaring Bridge turns off.

## Day 1

Draft is bumpy. GU is open, but I have had poor results with that deck. I force vampires, my usual, even though it seems like my neighbor is in the same deck. I also pick up a handful of green cards, including 2 [[Atzocan Seer]], but no payoffs to make green worth playing.

The speed of the draft is an issue for me. At least twice, I made the wrong pick due to time constraints.

My deck ends up mediocre. I have plenty of playables, good removal, and a splashed Huatli, but a shaky curve.

![Day 1 Draft](/assets/images/pt-rix-day-1-draft.png)

### Round 1: Loss 0-2 vs WB Vampires

I'm matched up against Trent, who sat to my right during the draft. I'm not sure if his deck is better than mine, but he definitely draws better. I stumble on lands game 1, then flood out game 2, while he curves [[Radiant Destiny]] into [[Call to the Feast]].

0-1

### Round 1: Win 2-0 vs URB Pirates

My match against Kazuyuki also isn't very interesting. He plays a few [[Daring Buccaneer:Daring Buccaneers]] and [[Dire Fleet Boarder:Dire Fleet Boarders]], but then draws a bunch of lands in a row while I draw nothing but gas.

1-1

### Round 3: Loss 0-2 vs UB Ascend

Tyler and I both got to play these games, at least, but they weren't particularly close. He shut down my board with [[Gleaming Barrier]] and [[Sailor of Means]], bounces my enchanted creatures, and works around my removal with [[Pirate's Cutlass]]. The games go long, since I chip away with lifelinkers, but my path to victory vanishes pretty quickly.

> This match is a rude awakening for me. I'd done some grinding online, maybe a dozen drafts, but I'd never run into a good Ascend deck before. This blew out of the water my experience that the format was only as deep as the tribal interactions.

---

### Round 4: Win 2-1 vs Naya Burn

Brandon

G1 stuck on 1 land
G2 he runs me over. kept a hand with sideboard cards but no ramp.
G3 he mulls twice then gets stuck on 1 land

> Honestly, I should not have won this round. Burn is a decent matchup, but my mulligan choices were pretty loose after a few weeks of nothing but Limited.

2-2

### Round 5: Win 2-1 vs Eldrazi Tron

Zhijan

Round 5 was Eldrazi Tron. My opponent made T3 TKS all three games, and blanked my Pacts with Chalice on zero, but in only one of those games did he make Ulamog before I landed Titan.

3-2

### Round 6: Win 2-1 vs Eldrazi Tron

Dominic

Round 6 was another Eldrazi Tron. Game 1 he won the roll and made T3 Tron into a bunch of Smashers. Game 2 he also had a T3 Smasher, but I hit back with T4 Breach for 24. Game 3 was close. He played triple TKS, keeping me off Titan. I held them off for a while with Thragtusk. I didn't play Valakut into his Ghost Quarter, do he had to blow Surgical Extraction on something unimportant to turn on his Sea Gate Wreckage. Ultimately I found Gaea's Revenge which chewed through his team.

4-2

> Locked for Day 2!

### Round 7: Win 2-1 vs UW Control

Huachao


Round 6 was UW control. I won the roll. He talked out for Gideon on 3, and I followed with Chalice... but I put it on 1 instead of 2. He proceeded to keep me off green with Spreading Seas and Field of Ruins. Game 2 he mulled then missed his third land drop. Game 3 he used Clique to keep me off Titan and put me on a clock, but it drew me into Gaea's Revenge. He shut me down with Runed Halo, but I eventually used Breach to force through a Reclamation Sage. He had three turns to find Cryptic to win the race, but he didn't.

5-2

### Round 8: Loss 0-2 vs Abzan

Konstantinos

Round 8 was against Abzan. I won the roll and kept a double-Pact hand. He Thoughtsiezes my Explore, then plays Flayer into Liliana. I discard a Pact to Liliana, draw Titan, discard another Pact (keeping Primus), play Titan, sacrifice it to Liliana. He then plays a pair of Tarmogofys, threatening lethal through a blocker. I topdeck Breach, but it isn't enough.

> In hindsight, my play was wrong. I should have played to win, not to stabilize. The second Titan is pretty much always game over.

I topdeck Breach and realize my punt; if I had kept Pact instead of Primus, it would have been a win. Game 2 wasn't close. I mulled to five. He went T1 IOK, T2 IOK + Thoughtsieze, T3 Liliana. He ultimated her twice in the time it took his Shambling Vent to beat me to death.


5-3

> A bad note to end on, but overall a very good day!

## Day 2

The draft, it seemed, went great. I went WB again, but this time it was open. I ended up light on removal, but my curve and synergies were good.

### Round 9: Draw 1-1-1 vs BRg Pirates





G1: I open on Martyr of Dusk into Mavren Fein into Voracious Vampire. Jon eventually finds Forerunner of the Empire and Raging Swordtooth to clear my board, but by then I'm at 40 and he's at 2.

G2: I have the same opening, but this time it doesn't go over as well. He has Swordtooth again, then Angrath, the Flame-Chained.

G3: My opening isn't as explosive, and Jon draws better removal, so I'm on the back foot from the start. I topdeck Vraska to stabilize while staring down lethal, then pretty much eat his team -- first Swordtooth, then Angrath. Unfortunately, our match goes long -- we run out of time with my win on the table.

5-3-1

> This round is officially a draw, but I'm counting it as a moral victory. At the start of game 3, we looked at the clock and agreed that we shouldn't draw. When we went to time, I had a win on the table and asked my opponent to concede, but he declined.

### Round 10: Loss 0-2 vs WUB Ascend

[Luis](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptrix/finals-salvatto-thompson-2018-02-04)


Luis (who goes on to top 8) has a nutty WUB Ascend deck with 3 Sailor of Means, 2 Deadeye Brawler, and 5 Waterknot. I go wide on tokens and manage to get him down to the low single digits, but eventually he plays a Zetalpa of his own to close out the game.

Game 2 I have an aggressive start (at this point I'm 5-for-5 on drawing Mevrin Fein) but he stabilizes and ultimately rides Air Elemental to victory.

5-4-1

### Round 11: Loss 0-2 vs WU Ascend

Kentaro

Kentaro takes G1 with UW flyers. G2 he's ahead in the race, but I land Jade Guardian + Squire's Devotion to slow the bleeding. I have six lands on the table. My hand is Plains + Evolving Wilds. I think to myself, "play to Zetalpa." Then I play the Plains. Then I draw Zetalpa. Kentaro plays a trick to get me exactly that turn.

> Greg points out that if I had sequenced my lands correctly, I would have shuffled away Zetalpa. This makes me feel better, but doesn't make the play any less wrong.

5-5-1

### Round 12: Loss 0-2 vs Affinity




G1: I win the roll against Niels, playing Affinity. I topdeck SSG to T3 Pact-Breach him (from the awkward board of Shock, Woodland, Mountain, Valakut). I've drawn Woodland naturally so I can't really wipe his board (Ornithopter + Signal Pest), but I do set up a win on my next upkeep. He plays Ravager, eats his board, and swings for exactly 10 poison with Inky.

> There's nothing I could have done to stop Niels' T3 kill, but in hindsight I still think my play was wrong.
> Could have killed Signal Pest and Ornithopter, but not Inky or his noncreature artifacts. And that doesn't even save me. He can then just make a 5/5 Inky and kill me over two turns while I pay for Pact.
> I should have left mana up on T3. He may have respected Bolt enough not to eat his team. And I still get to win on T4.
> Notably, I could Breach a Hornet Queen on T3, which makes it almost impossible for Affinity to win, but I didn't have double green.
> His board was

G2: I keep a hand with Valakut, Fetch, 2 Ancient Grudge, and Anger of the Gods. In five turns, I never draw a third land.

5-6-1

### Round 13: Win 2-1 vs Scapeshift

Mirror match. I take the play, and it seems like Pang Ming draws poorly. I cast Titan on T4. He double-Bolts it, but I finish him with Sakura-Tribe Elder and a land drop.

G2, I buy a turn with Thragtusk, but he takes it back with Beast Within. He Bolts me for style points, then casts Scapeshift for 36.

G3 he goes to 24 with Obstinate Baloth, starts beating down, and ends T4 with 6 lands. I have Pact + Breach in my hand. I consider getting Primus to play around double Bolt, but decide to go for it. Breach plus my land drop gets him for exactly 24.

6-6-1

### Round 14: Win 2-0 vs Eldrazi Tron

I mull to 5 on the draw again.
