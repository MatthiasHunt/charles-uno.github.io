Slice the orange and remove any seeds. Put the orange and the sugar in the food processor and blend briefly.

Add cranberries and pulse to the desired consistency. The bigger the pieces, the more crunch there will be!

Let the relish sit overnight in the fridge. The sugar will draw juice out of the berries, improving both the color and the flavor.
