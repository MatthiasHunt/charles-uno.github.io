Removing the second basic Forest

Tried out Kitchen Finks

Chalice in the main is a hedge against Storm, Lantern, Shadow. Other options for the main are probably Anger of the Gods and Tireless Tracker.

I love Ancient Grudge. Affinity is always a real deck, and even a single Grudge in my opening hand makes it very difficult for them to win a game.

I'm down on Baloth, since Liliana isn't getting played as much recently. Thragtusk's 5 power is relevant against Shadow as well as Eldrazi Tron.

Against midrange and control decks, Ruric Thar is a miscellaneous must-answer threat. It's also basically game over against Lantern. If they cast spells, he punches them; if they don't, Ensnaring Bridge turns off.

## Day 1

Draft is bumpy. GU is open, but I have had poor results with that deck. I force vampires, my usual, even though it seems like my neighbor is in the same deck. I also pick up a handful of green cards, including 2 [[Atzocan Seer]], but no payoffs to make green worth playing.

The speed of the draft is an issue for me. At least twice, I made the wrong pick due to time constraints.

My deck ends up mediocre. I have plenty of playables, good removal, and a splashed Huatli, but a shaky curve.

![Day 1 Draft Deck](/assets/images/pt-rix-day-1-draft.png)
*Day 1 draft deck.*

### Round 1: Loss 0-2 vs WB Vampires

I'm matched up against Trent, who sat to my right during the draft. I'm not sure if his deck is better than mine, but he definitely draws better. I stumble on lands game 1, then flood out game 2, while he curves [[Radiant Destiny]] into [[Call to the Feast]].

0-1

### Round 1: Win 2-0 vs URB Pirates

My match against Kazuyuki also isn't very interesting. He plays a few [[Daring Buccaneer:Daring Buccaneers]] and [[Dire Fleet Boarder:Dire Fleet Boarders]], but then draws a bunch of lands in a row while I draw nothing but gas.

1-1

### Round 3: Loss 0-2 vs UB Ascend

Tyler and I both got to play these games, at least, but they weren't particularly close. He shut down my board with [[Gleaming Barrier]] and [[Sailor of Means]], bounces my enchanted creatures, and works around my removal with [[Pirate's Cutlass]]. The games go long, since I chip away with lifelinkers, but my path to victory vanishes pretty quickly.

> This match is a rude awakening for me. I'd done some grinding online, maybe a dozen drafts, but I'd never run into a good Ascend deck before. This blew out of the water my experience that the format was only as deep as the tribal interactions.

---

### Round 4: Win 2-1 vs Naya Burn

**Game 1**: I win the roll and keep an iffy six. Brandon gets stuck on one land, though, so my T5 [[Through the Breach:Breach]] is good enough.

**Game 2:** This time, I get punished for my bad mulligan choice. I keep a hand with [[Obstinate Baloth:Baloth]] and [[Thragtusk]] but no ramp spells, and get run over too fast to play either.

**Game 3:** Brandon mulls to five and gets stuck on one land again.

2-2

### Round 5: Win 2-1 vs Eldrazi Tron

**Game 1:** Zhijan wins the roll and plays T3 [[Thought-Knot Seer:TKS]], but my topdeck lets me [[Through the Breach:Breach]] a [[Primeval Titan:Titan]] anyway.

**Game 2:** He plays [[Chalice of the Void:Chalice]] on zero to shut down my [[Summoner's Pact:Pacts]], then another T3 [[Thought-Knot Seer:TKS]], backed up by [[Basilisk Collar:Collar]]-[[Endbringer]]. I get [[Gaea's Revenge]] on the table, but it's not enough to deal with his [[Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger:Ulamog]].

**Game 3:** Zhijan plays yet another T3 [[Thought-Knot Seer:TKS]], this time into T4 [[Reality Smasher:Smasher]]. He uses [[Warping Wail]] to sneak an Eldrazi Scion in there too, forcing my [[Primeval Titan:Titan]] to block [[Reality Smasher:Smasher]] (rather than [[Thought-Knot Seer:TKS]]) and taking me to 1. But he can't actually get rid of the [[Primeval Titan:Titan]], so I wrap things up as soon as I untap.

3-2

### Round 6: Win 2-1 vs Eldrazi Tron

**Game 1:** Dominic wins the roll and makes T3 [[Thought-Knot Seer:TKS]] into a bunch of [[Reality Smasher:Smashers]]. It ends badly.

**Game 2:** He makes T3 [[Reality Smasher:Smasher]]. I answer with T4 [[Through the Breach:Breach]] for 24.

**Game 3:** Dom plays triple [[Thought-Knot Seer:TKS]] to keep me off [[Primeval Titan:Titan]], and [[Ghost Quarter]] keeps [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle]] stuck in my hand. He floods a bit, though, and I find [[Gaea's Revenge]] to chew through his team.

4-2

> Locked for Day 2!

### Round 7: Win 2-1 vs UW Control

**Game 1:** I win the roll and ramp a bit. Huachao taps out for [[Gideon of the Trials:Gideon]] on T3, which gives me an opening to cast [[Chalice of the Void:Chalice]] -- but I put it on 1 instead of 2. He proceeds to keep me off green with [[Spreading Seas]] and [[Field of Ruin]].

**Game 2:** Huachao stumbles on lands and I punish him for it.

**Game 3:** He uses [[Mistbind Clique:Clique]] to keep me off [[Primeval Titan:Titan]], but it draws me into [[Gaea's Revenge]]. He has me on a clock, and uses [[Runed Halo]] to shut down my attacks, but eventually I use Breach to eat a counterspell, throw [[Ruric Thar, the Unbowed:Ruric Thar]] under another one, and resolve [[Reclamation Sage]] to blow up the [[Runed Halo]]. Huachao had three turns to find a [[Cryptic Command]] to win the race, but he didn't.

5-2

### Round 8: Loss 0-2 vs Abzan

**Game 1:** I win the roll and keep a top-heavy seven. Konstantinos [[Thoughtsieze:Thoughtsiezes]] my [[Explore]], then plays T2 [[Grim Flayer:Flayer]] into T3 [[Liliana of the Veil:Liliana]]. I discard [[Summoner's Pact]] to [[Liliana of the Veil:Liliana]]; he plays [[Tarmogoyf]]. Then I draw and play [[Primeval Titan:Titan]]. [[Liliana of the Veil:Liliana]] eats the [[Primeval Titan:Titan]], then he plays a new [[Liliana of the Veil:Liliana]] to drop me to one card; I discard [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]], keeping [[Woodfall Primus:Primus]]. Then he plays another [[Tarmogoyf]], putting me dead through a blocker. I draw [[Through the Breach:Breach]] and scoop.

> Discarding the [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]] instead of the [[Woodfall Primus:Primus]] was sloppy. [[Woodfall Primus:Primus]] would maybe have gotten there, but with two active [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut]] I really want a second [[Primeval Titan:Titan]] to close out the game.
>
> This is the first time I punt a game due to fatigue. It's not the last.

**Game 2:** Mulling against black midrange feels awful, but my seven and six are both unkeepable. Konstantinos goes T1 [[Inquisition of Kozilek:IOK]] into T2 [[Inquisition of Kozilek:IOK]]-[[Thoughtsieze]] into T3 [[Liliana of the Veil:Liliana]]. He hasn't got much of a clock -- just a lonely [[Shambling Vent]] -- so he ultimates [[Liliana of the Veil:Liliana]] twice in the time it takes to put me out of my misery.

5-3

A bad note to end on, but overall a very good day!

## Day 2

The draft, it seemed, went great. I went WB again, but this time it was open. I ended up light on removal, but my curve and synergies were good.

### Round 9: Draw 1-1-1 vs BRg Pirates

**Game 1:** I win the roll and curve T2 [[Martyr of Dusk]] into T3 [[Mevrin Fein, Dusk Apostle:Mevrin Fein]] into T3 [[Voracious Vampire]]. Jon eventually finds [[Forerunner of the Empire]] and [[Raging Swordtooth]] to clear my board, but by then I'm at 40 and he's at 2.

**Game 2:** I have the same opening, but this time it doesn't go over as well. He has [[Raging Swordtooth:Swordtooth]] right away, then [[Angrath, the Flame-Chained]].

**Game 3:** My opening isn't as explosive, and Jon draws better removal, so I'm on the back foot from the start. I topdeck [[Vraska]] to stabilize while staring down lethal, then pretty much eat his team -- first [[Raging Swordtooth:Swordtooth]], then [[Angrath, the Flame-Chained]]. Unfortunately, with haymakers going back and forth, our match goes long.

5-3-1

> This round is officially a draw, but I'm counting it as a moral victory. At the start of game 3, we looked at the clock and agreed that we shouldn't draw. When we went to time, I had a win on the table. I asked Jon to concede, but he declined.

### Round 10: Loss 0-2 vs WUB Ascend

**Game 1:** [Luis](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptrix/finals-salvatto-thompson-2018-02-04) has a nutty WUB Ascend deck with 3 [[Sailor of Means]], 2 [[Deadeye Brawler]], and 5 [[Waterknot]]. I go wide on tokens and manage to get him down to 5, but he puts a [[Waterknot]] on all my creatures that matter and then eventually he plays a [[Zetalpa, Primal Calamity:Zetalpa]] of his own to close out the game.

**Game 2:** I have an aggressive start (at this point I'm 5-for-5 on drawing [[Mevrin Fein, Dusk Apostle:Mevrin Fein]]) but he stabilizes and ultimately rides [[Air Elemental]] to victory.

5-4-1

### Round 11: Loss 0-2 vs WU Ascend

**Game 1:** Kentaro's well-timed [[Pacifism]] turns the race in his favor, and my removal doesn't line up well with his [[Spire Winder:Spire Winders]].

**Game 2:** He taken an early lead in the race, but I land [[Jade Guardian]] with [[Squire's Devotion]] to slow the bleeding. I have six lands on the table. My hand is [[Plains]] plus [[Evolving Wilds]]. I think to myself, "play to [[Zetalpa, Primal Calamity:Zetalpa]]." Then I play the [[Plains]]. Then I draw [[Zetalpa, Primal Calamity:Zetalpa]]. Kentaro has a pump spell to finish me off that turn.

> Greg points out that if I had sequenced my lands correctly, I would have shuffled away [[Zetalpa, Primal Calamity:Zetalpa]]. This makes me feel better, but doesn't make the play any less wrong.

5-5-1

### Round 12: Loss 0-2 vs Affinity

**Game 1:** I win the roll against Niels, play [[Sakura-Tribe Elder:Steve]] on two, and topdeck [[Simian Spirit Guide:SSG]] on T3 to [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]]-[[Through the Breach:Breach]]. I've drawn [[Blighted Woodland:Woodland]] and [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut]] naturally, so I search up two more [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut:Valakuts]] and a pair of Mountains. This sets me up to win on my upkeep by popping [[Blighted Woodland:Woodland]] for 18 damage (my attack had already knocked him to 13). Unfortunately, Niels topdecks a zero-cost artifact, plays [[Arcbound Ravager:Ravager]], and eats his board to hit me for 10 poison exactly.

> There's nothing I could have done to meaningfully disrupt his T3 win. I couldn't [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]] for [[Hornet Queen]], since I didn't have double-green to pay for it. And if I got extra mountains (instead of [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakuts]]) to kill his [[Signal Pest:Pest]] and [[Ornithopter]], he would just poison me over two turns while I paid for [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]].
>
> But I still think I could have won this game.
>
> If I have mana up, I doubt Niels would have gone for the T3 kill, opening himself up to an 8-for-1 [[Lightning Bolt]]. With only four lands on the table, I wasn't broadcasting a win on my T4.
>
> So I was supposed to wait, leave mana up on his turn, and use [[Simian Spirit Guide:SSG]] to crack [[Blighted Woodland:Woodland]] on his end step. Then on my T4, I can [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]]-[[Through the Breach:Breach]] for 24.

**Game 2:** I keep a hand with 2 lands, 2 [[Ancient Grudge:Grudges]], [[Anger of the Gods:Anger]], [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]], and [[Sakura-Tribe-Elder:Steve]]. I draw zero lands in the next five turns, while Niels plays double [[Arcbound Ravager:Ravager]].

5-6-1

### Round 13: Win 2-1 vs Scapeshift

**Game 1:** I take the play, and it seems like Pang Ming draws poorly. I cast [[Primeval Titan:Titan]] on T4. He double-[[Lightning Bolt:Bolts]] it on his next turn, but I make a land drop and [[Sakura-Tribe Elder:Steve]] to seal the deal.

**Game 2:** I buy a turn with [[Thragtusk]], but he takes it back with [[Beast Within]]. He [[Lightning Bolt:Bolts]] me for style points, then casts [[Scapeshift]] for 36.

**Game 3:** He goes to 24 with [[Obstinate Baloth:Baloth]], then makes the mistake of turning it sideways. He's on six lands when I draw [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]], so I consider [[Through the Breach:Breaching]] [[Woodfall Primus:Primus]] in case he has double-[[Lightning Bolt:Bolt]] again. I choose to live dangerously and jam [[Primeval Titan:Titan]] for exactly 24.

6-6-1

### Round 14: Win 2-0 vs Eldrazi Tron

**Game 1:** I mull to 5 on the draw again, but luckily it's against Eldrazi Tron. Leon makes T2 Matter Reshaper into T3 [[Thought-Knot Seer:TKS]] into T4 [[Endbringer]], knocking me to 4. But I drew a [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut]] naturally, so my T4 [[Primeval Titan:Titan]] kills his [[Endbringer]] and shuts down his attack. He plays [[Chalice of the Void:Chalice]] for 0; I respond with [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]] for a second [[Primeval Titan:Titan]]; he scoops.

**Game 2:** Leon again knocks me to 4 before I land a [[Primeval Titan:Titan]], but then I blow up a pair of [[Thought-Knot Seer:TKSs]] and drop a [[Hornet Queen]].

> Probably ten times this weekend, my opponents could have won if they topdecked [[Walking Ballista]]. None of them ever did.

### Round 15: Loss 1-2 to UW Control

**Game 1:** Eugen drops a quick [[Runed Halo]], then goes after my green sources. I punch him for six with a [[Through the Breach:Breached]] [[Primeval Titan:Titan]], then continue chipping away with [[Simian Spirit Guide::SSG]] and [[Hornet Queen]] (though her tokens get [[Detention Sphere:detained]]). I use [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut]] triggers to blow up his [[Celestial Cannonade:Cannonades]], but draw my last [[Mountain]] at an inopportune moment[^15].

[^15]: I can only use [[Wooded Foothills]] to blow up a [[Celestial Cannonade:Cannonades]] if there are [[Mountain:Mountains]] left in my deck.

**Game 2:** He mulls, plays [[Runed Halo]], then misses his third land drop. I play [[Through the Breach:Breach]] on his end step, which he counters, then main phase [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]]-[[Through the Breach:Breach]] a [[Woodfall Primus]] to blow up both his lands.

**Game 3:** He plays [[Spreading Seas]] on my [[Stomping Ground]] and leaves up double [[Field of Ruin]]. I pact for [[Gaea's Revenge]] to knock him down to six. He then blows up my green sources.

> I know. It's real bad. This loss wasn't even tilting -- it just made me realize how exhausted I was.

7-7-1

### Round 16: Loss 0-2 to Jeskai Geist

**Game 1:** Sean wins the roll and has [[Logic Knot]] for my [[Explore]], then slams T3 [[Geist of Saint Traft:Geist]] into T4 [[Lightning Bolt:Bolt]]-[[Snapcaster Mage:Snap]]-[[Lightning Bolt:Bolt]]. I bait out a [[Spell Queller]] with [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]] to resolve [[Primeval Titan:Titan]], then use my land drop to shoot his [[Spell Queller:Queller]], but at that point it's too late. He suicides [[Geist of Saint Traft:Geist]] into my [[Primeval Titan:Titan]] and burns me out.

**Game 2:** No [[Geist of Saint Traft:Geist]] this time, but Sean starts beating down with [[Spell Queller:Queller]] (snagging nothing) into [[Lightning Helix:Helix]]-[[Snapcaster Mage:Snap]]-[[Lightning Helix:Helix]]. I draw a pair of [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakuts]] naturally, and knock him to ten with [[Gaea's Revenge]], but I'm not exactly winning the race. It seems like he's going to flash something in on my end step to ensure a lethal attack. I leave up [[Through the Breach:Breach]] instead of casting [[Anger of the Gods:Anger]] in case it's a [[Spell Queller:Queller]]. He casts [[Snapcaster Mage:Snap]], and I try to [[Through the Breach:Breach]] a [[Primeval Titan:Titan]]. Unfortunately, he has [[Disdainful Stroke]].
