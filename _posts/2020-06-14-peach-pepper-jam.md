Peach jam is a classic condiment, and a touch of heat makes it unusual without being weird. This stuff is great on a bagel, a cheese plate, or a grilled chicken sandwich. Little jars of homemade jam also make charming gifts!

In terms of a recipe, the title really says it all:

- Follow the instructions on a box of pectin.
- Add a spoonful of minced hot pepper to each <span class="metric">liter</span><span class="imperial">quart</span> of prepared peaches before cooking.

When I say hot peppers, I do mean *hot*. A spoonful of jalapeÃ±o doesn't have enough firepower to cut the sweetness, and adding more can interfere with the texture of the jam. Go for a thin-walled pepper like a habanero or bird's eye chile. This recipe also works well with more exotic varieties like [ghost peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhut_jolokia) and [Carolina Reapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Reaper). Make sure you wear gloves when preparing them!

> note: would be fun to get this in here, but I think it's overkill. nobody's gonna start growing superhot peppers just so they can put them in jam

*Hot peppers are easy to grow at home, and [keep well](/farm-freezer) in the freezer!*
