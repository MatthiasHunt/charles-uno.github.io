Just about any list of worst SCOTUS[^1] decisions starts with the same four cases:

- In [Dred Scott v Sandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford) (1857), SCOTUS voted 7-2 that persons of African descent cannot be US citizens, and thus have no standing to sue in federal court.

> This decision disenfranchised *millions?* of free Blacks, and undid the ceasefire of the Kansas-Nebraska Act

- In [Plessy v Ferguson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson) (1896), they voted 7-1 to endorse the doctrine of "separate but equal," opening the door to racially segregated housing, schooling, and transportation.

> Estimated impact?

- In [Buck v Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_v._Bell) (1927), SCOTUS voted 8-1 to allow forced sterilization of the "feeble minded" and "promiscuous"[^2]. This decision was cited in defense of Nazi doctors during the Nuremburg trials.

> How many women were affected? Continued into the 70s?

- In [Korematsu v US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korematsu_v._United_States) (1944), SCOTUS voted 6-3 to allow FDR's incarceration of Japanese Americans, including US citizens, for the duration of WWII. Over 100k people were forcibly relocated, robbed of their homes and businesses.

[^1]: SCOTUS: Supreme Court of the United States

[^2]: Not surprisingly, sterilization was disproportionately imposed on persons of color. For more information, look up "Mississippi appendectomy."

In each case, the court erred on the side of the powerful, rather than defending the rights of the powerless. This should come as no surprise. SCOTUS justices are confirmed by the Senate, and the purpose of the Senate has always been to represent the interests of the powerful.

In the Federalist Papers [#62](https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-62) and [#63](https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-63), America's framers[^3] show little faith in the ability of the House of Representatives to govern responsibly. Due to its short terms and direct election by the people, Madison argued that the government could be destabilized by the electorate's "sudden and violent passions." Senators, on the other hand, were to be professional politicians exhibiting "stability of character." They were insulated from the voters by their indirect election[^4] and long terms of office.

[^3]: Written by Madison, but it's not strictly his opinions. He's trying to spell out what was argued at the the Constitutional Convention.

[^4]: Direct election of senators. 17th Amendment.







served



Madison wrote of the Senate -- professional politicians who served longer terms and were *not* directly elected by the people -- "such an institution may be sometimes necessary as a defense to the people against their own temporary errors and delusions."


Due to its short terms and direct election by the people, they argue, the government could be destabilized by the electorate's










> TODO -- what about how senators are now directly elected?








Framers were aware that -- due to the small number of senators and their long terms -- comparisons could be drawn to hereditary aristocracy.

Some were more hostile than others. John Dickinson wanted the Senate to bear "as strong a likeness to the British House of Lords as possible."

Federalist Papers 63 acknowledged the concern that Senate could become "tyrannical aristocracy." but argued that the Senate had little power because it could not enact laws on its own

at the time, the federal government (cabinet posts, courts) had little power

17th amendment. senators are now directly elected, rather than being chosen by state legislatures. even so, there's an aristocratic feel. the senate is 90% white (house is 78%, US overall is 62%), and the median senator is worth over a million dollars (median representative is worth less than half that)




a generation later, Marbury v Madison. Judicial review. suddenly courts have the power to strike down laws. this is a significant increase in the power of the courts, and thus the Senate.




















Framers had that concern in mind when they designed it, but they couldn't have foreseen the drastic changes that were coming.

John Dickinson: "distinguished for their rank in life and their weight of property, and bearing as strong a likeness to the British House of Lords as possible" [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Senate#cite_note-3)



originally, senators were not directly elected.

representation in the senate is not proportional.

framers had little trust in the electorate. "such an institution may be sometimes necessary as a defense to the people against their own temporary errors and delusions"

Federalist Papers 63 acknowledged the concern that Senate could become "tyrannical aristocracy." but blows it off because the Senate has little power. It would have to corrupt the House and the electorate to sustain any corruption

at the time, the federal government (cabinet posts, courts) had little power

a generation later, Marbury v Madison. Judicial review. suddenly courts have the power to strike down laws. this is a significant increase in the power of the courts, and thus the Senate.

another generation, and we have the Civil War. huge consolidation of federal power. dramatic expansion of who could be a citizen.

reconstruction, the Jim Crow era, Civil Rights... establishes the federal government's ability (and responsibility) to enforce civil rights. federal opposition to state-level disenfranchisement.










In the [Federalist Papers 63](https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-63), Hamilton/Madison specifically acknowledges the concern that the Senate would become a "tyrannical aristocracy"










"stable institution" in the government, free from the distraction of rapid turnover

"stability of character"

insulated from "impulse of sudden and violent passions"

expectation that Representatives would be elected part-time from all walks of life, and would need the assistance of professional legislators.

No trust in proportional representation.

"the jealous adversary of the Constitution will probably content himself with repeating, that a senate appointed not immediately by the people, and for the term of six years, must gradually acquire a dangerous pre-eminence in the government, and finally transform it into a tyrannical aristocracy" ... "liberty may be endangered by the abuses of liberty as well as by the abuses of power"

Also argues that the Senate doesn't have much power to make a mess itself. if you want tyranny, Senate has to corrupt the other branches as well. This is before judicial review.

[Marbury v Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison) (1803). establishes that courts have the power to strike down laws (etc) -- ostensibly, per the Constitution.


Points out that the House of Lords lost influence when the monarch pulled support from it.

*something something log scale!*

(1) Senate is modeled after the UK's House of Lords. Basically nobility from each state. (Use a quote from the Convention.)

Despite the 17th amendment (direct election of senators, rather than selection by the state legislature), the aristocratic nature persists.

Senate is 80% male (about the same as the House), [90% white](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/24/115th-congress-sets-new-high-for-racial-ethnic-diversity/) (House if 78%, US overall is 62%). [Net worth](https://www.rollcall.com/news/hawkings/congress-richer-ever-mostly-top) of the median Senator is just north of $1M (House is $400k).

(2) Senate is gerrymandered to give disproportionate representation to rural (that is, white) Americans.

2015: US overall is 62% non-hispanic white [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States)

But if you give each state equal weight, you get 71% non-hispanic white.

The Senate never offered proportional representation. In 1790, the first census, one third of the population controlled almost two thirds of the Senate[^1]. Since then, it's become a bit worse; [by 2040](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-variedand-globalthreats-confronting-democracy-1511193763), 30% of the US population is expected to control 70% of the Senate. Unsurprisingly, such skewed representation was controversial from the start. At the Constitutional Convention, Hamilton called the Senate "[confessedly unjust](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/debcont.asp)." Madison spoke against it as well, but ultimately endorsed it as a "[lesser evil](https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-62)" -- without such a [compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise), smaller states may have refused to join the union.

[^1]: Two thirds of the population lived in six states. The other third was spread across ten (and so held 20/32 seats in the Senate).

Modern retellings tend to be a bit more poetic. Charles C W Cooke, editor of National Review, [writes](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/senate-hasnt-skewed-supreme-court-to-right/):

> Provided that federal power remains in check, the Senate prevents no state from enacting whichever policies it wishes to within its border; it merely prevents a handful of states from riding roughshod over their smaller counterparts on those few questions that are inherently national. Thus was the republic deliberately arranged.

At face value, Cooke's framing seems reasonable. It sounds a lot like the EU, where each state is largely autonomous, but interstate and international relations are facilitated by the union. But it does beg the question: over the past few centuries, which issues have prompted America's small states to throw their weight around in the Senate?

The answer is damning:

- During Jim Crow, local authorities would often turn a blind eye to the lynching of African Americans. The House passed a [bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyer_Anti-Lynching_Bill) to make lynching a federal crime, but it was filibustered to death in the Senate.
- In 1946, the House passed a bill abolishing the poll tax for federal elections. It was [halted in the Senate](https://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal46-1411331) via filibuster. Poll taxes continued to disenfranchise poor (especially Black) voters in the South until the [24th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), eighteen years later.
- Sen Thurmond spoke for over 24 hours straight to filibuster the [Civil Rights Act of 1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957). This is the longest filibuster in US history.
- Southern senators filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for two months. The filibuster was ultimately broken by weakening the bill.

Senate was disproportionate from the start. It's now a bit worse than it was.

House is supposed to be swingy, since the whole chamber gets reelected every two years. But it's actually been pretty steady. You get extreme behavior when the national vote is very skewed.

Control of the Senate we might expect to be smoother, since it's averaged over three classes. And, indeed, the vote share is much less swingy. But the representation is *more* swingy. From 1956 to 1994, between 44% and 50% of voters voted for a GOP senator. 32 to 54 senators.

*In the House, seat allocation (white) is roughly proportional with two-party[^2] vote share (red/blue), with swings at the extremes[^3]. It's very unusual for a minority of voters to control a majority of seats. In the Senate, seats swing wildly. The majority party in the Senate has been elected by a minority of voters about half the time since 1980.*


[^2]: Disproportionate representation is expected when one party is *much* more popular than the other. For example, if the national popular vote is 60% Republican to 40% Democrat, Democrats will only win districts with a [partisan lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index) of D+20 or more -- and districts like that are rare!

[^3]: Two-party vote share means votes for third-party candidates are ignored.


Notably, southern states could not resist the reconstruction amendments to the US constitution because rebel states were controlled by reconstruction governments from the end of the Civil War until 1877.

[Senate website](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Filibuster_Cloture.htm): "Filibusters were particularly useful to Southern senators who sought to block civil rights legislation"

Federal powers are far more expansive now than they were in the 18th century. Specifically, the federal government has since taken on an important role that the founders did not envision: defense of minority rights. The civil war and its aftermath were an unprecedented consolidation of federal power. Likewise, all civil rights legislation has infringed upon the rights of states to manage their internal affairs (especially elections).

Current Senate is disproportionate way beyond what the founders would have known. In 1790, the first census, the ratio between the biggest state and the smallest was nine-to-one (Virginia 450k, Delaware 50k). They might have expected states to break up. In the 18th century, borders were in flux within the US. Kentucky was formerly a piece of Virginia, and Vermont was split off of NH/NY. Even national borders weren't settled in the 18th century! Modern-day Germany was divided between Prussia, the Habsburgs, and a number of small states. Italy didn't exist yet. The Ottoman Empire covered Turkey and the Balkans.

[Wikipedia Connecticut Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise): "Madison argued that a conspiracy of large states against the small states was unrealistic as the large states were so different from each other."

There is value in a bicameral legislature, to divide representation along more than one axis.

To be a bit silly, imagine a chamber with 26 seats, one for each letter of the alphabet. You vote based on your initial. This would probably serve to elevate minority voices -- for example, Yang and Vang are common named among Asian Americans, but few European names start with those letters.

More practically, consider a chamber in which you vote for a seat based on your profession. There's a seat to represent plumbers, another for teachers, another for firefighters, another for programmers. It's likely that this chamber would offer a significantly different perspective from our existing Congress, which is dominated by lawyers.

In that sense, the Senate is fine -- but as a lower chamber. The lower chamber steers the upper and adds friction. Makes unified control of government more difficult, adds incentive to compromise, facilitates novel solutions. But the US Senate is the upper chamber, unambiguously more powerful than the House (in a parliamentary system, it's traditionally the other way around). SCOTUS is the most visible example, but also cabinet confirmations and the filibuster.

Basically no action on civil rights for a century. A few laws passed during reconstruction, but they were dismantled/undermined by state/local laws. Some were struck down by SCOTUS. Substance took a century. Brown v Board of Education (1954), Civil Rights Act (1964), Voting Rights Act (1965)

The fact that the Senate gives a disproportionate voice to southern whites is likely why important civil rights victories were dispensed by SCOTUS rather than being legislated. Brown v Board of Education, Loving v Virginia.

If we're going to give disproportionate representation to one group, why is it rural whites, who (1) are a big enough voting bloc to look out for themselves, and (2) have shitty priorities, specifically racism
