Donating a kidney is invasive and inconvenient, but remarkably safe.
Post-op recovery lasts [about a month][donor_recovery], and after that there are generally no ill effects.
Kidney donors have about the same [life expectancy][kidney_life_expectancy] as the general public, and fatal complications are exceptionally rare (more on this below).
For the recipient, on the other hand, kidney donation is a matter of life and death.
Dialysis only works for a few years.
[Thousands of Americans die each year][donation_stats] due to a shortage of organ donors.

Despite the relative stakes, organ donation in the USA is [strictly voluntary][donation_requires_consent].
The government cannot force you to donate a kidney to save the life of a child.
It cannot force you to donate in cases where you are the only possible donor.
Even after promising to donate a kidney, you can [change your mind at any time][donor_can_change_mind].

To be clear, this is a good thing.
Bodily autonomy is a fundamental human right.
Government-mandated organ harvesting is an egregious violation of that right --- even if the organs would be used to save the lives of children.


Only [about half of Americans][organ_donor_rate] are registered as organ donors.

If we reject government-mandated kidney donation, we should reject government-mandated pregnancy just as forcefully:



- Carrying a pregnancy to term has a similar mortality rate to donating a kidney. In the USA, about 17 pregnant women per 100k die due to complications of pregnancy or delivery. About 19 kidney donors per 100k die due to complications of the operation.


In the short term, carrying a pregnancy to term is more serious than donating a kidney.
- Restrictive diet
- Weight gain
- Hormonal changes
- Length of recovery (note: c section)

Pregnancy comes with serious long-term consequences too.



Plus: criminalizing abortion comes with barbaric side effects.






[^1]: In the USA, about 17 pregnant women per 100k die due to complications of pregnancy or delivery. The Depending on how you count, donating a kidney has a mortality rate between 7 per 100k and

The mortality rate for kidney donors is between [7 per 100k][kidney_mortality_1] and [31 per 100k][kidney_mortality_2], depending on how you count. For comparison, about [8 people per 100k][lightning_odds] get struck by lightning.

A first-trimester fetus can't survive outside the womb.
Terminating the pregnancy dooms the fetus

Terminating a pregnancy dooms the fetus, just as withholding an organ dooms a prospective recipient.

Abortion law in TN assumes guilt. Doctors have to mount an affirmative defense that the procedure was necessary. Chilling effect.

Half of all conceptions are naturally aborted, usually before the woman even knows she's pregnant. If anyone truly believed life begins at conception, there would be resources here.

Catholic church tolerates abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy. Fetus grows in the fallopian tube instead of the womb. Dangerous for both -- but there are recorded cases of both surviving birth. Scholarly tradition. They have to admit that biology is complicated.
