The day after Trump was sworn in as president, [Women's March](https://www.womensmarch.com/) protests drew an estimated 3.2M people -- [ten times as many](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-long-march-ahead-for-democrats/) as the Tea Party protests that followed Obama's inauguration in 2009. I attended the march at the Minnesota Capitol, which drew about 100k people, and came away conflicted.

The invited [speakers](https://www.womensmarchmn.com/rally) -- including Rep Betty McCollum, Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, and State Rep Ilhan Omar -- struck a forward-looking tone. They drummed up support for healthcare access, racial justice, LGBT rights, and female representation in government. Several speakers echoed Hillary's iconic line from Beijing, "women's rights are human rights." References to Trump were infrequent, and while he was always the opponent, speakers avoided sensationalist labels like "enemy," "evil," "fascist," and "Nazi."

In contrast, the crowd's signs struck a reactionary tone: jabs at Trump's hands and hair, images of Trump with a Hitler-style mustache, and "this pussy grabs back." For every poster about unity or progress, there was another fixated on opposition. I was particularly struck by "Not My President" -- the same slogan [used by the Tea Party](http://www.cafepress.com/rightwingstuff/6166025) against Obama.

The rift between speakers and signholders was reminiscent of the 2016 Democratic primaries. The speakers showed an optimistic view of democracy: two steps forward, one step back. They chose their words to appeal widely, due to their belief that people are [Stronger Together](http://www.npr.org/2016/08/08/489138602/trump-comment-gives-clinton-a-campaign-slogan-with-layered-meaning). The signholders were comparably new to the political scene; they were mostly young, mostly white, and mostly angry. And they seemed eager to tear down the system in a [Political Revolution](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/25/bernie-sanders-started-a-political-revolution-now-he-cant-stop-it/).

My first instinct was to recoil from any semblance of a left-wing Tea Party. I'm concerned at the prospect of establishment Democrats facing primary challenges from blowhard "outsiders." Rumblings are already visible on social media; Sen Elizabeth Warren (among the most stalwart progressives in the Senate) is [choosing her battles](https://www.facebook.com/senatorelizabethwarren/posts/716640075165155) -- but to many of her commenters, anything short of obstruction is a betrayal. That same sort of [ideological purity test](http://time.com/4205149/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-progressive/) is what hollowed out the leadership of the Republican Party, making room for Trump in the first place.

A Sanders- or Tea-Party-style insurgency would also lay bare the Democratic Party's [racial fault line](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/2016-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-democrats-race-racial-divide-213948). Nationally, [about half](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html) of Democratic voters are people of color, but in the 2016 presidential primaries Sanders won 45% of the vote despite losing Black voters [three-to-one](http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/how-clinton-won/). In a contest with more than two candidates, or in less-diverse parts of the country, it's easy to imagine voters of color being steamrolled in the primaries then [taken for granted](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-voters-are-so-loyal-that-their-issues-get-ignored/) in the general election.

It seems to me that the left should be trying to make its tent bigger, not smaller. 

The Democratic Party should embrace people who share broad goals (healthcare access, racial justice, LGBT rights, livable wages, etc), even if there are points of disagreement. 

Democrats are not homogeneous about [gun control](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/08/obamas-hollow-threat-to-pro-gun-democrats/) or [pharmaceutical regulation](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/18/other-98/viral-image-about-democratic-senators-and-big-phar/). 

Democrats were divided over TPP, Obama's complicated (and [now dead](http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-withdraws-u-s-from-trans-pacific-partnership-1485191020)) Pacific trade agreement. 

In a nation as large as the United States, ideological diversity is inevitable. 

To compete for Senate seats in Louisiana, maybe Democrats need to be comfortable sharing a tent with candidates who buck the party line on [abortion](http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/elections/article_23164d56-b69d-11e6-bf42-d7d1be691328.html)[^3]. 

[^3]: The Women's March [excluded pro-life groups](https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/01/25/anti-abortion-group-of-banned-womens-march-protesters-showed-up/21662068/). According to the event website, "[access to safe, legal, affordable abortion](https://www.womensmarch.com/principles/)" was an core principle of the march, so endorsing a pro-life presence would have muddled the message. Recall Occupy Wall Street: protests can't be powerful unless they're coherent. However, in practice, the event was more or less a rally for the Democratic Party. Pro-life Democrats exist, and they deserve a place under the tent. (If the DNC only supported across-the-board progressives, it would be unable to compete for Senate seats in conservative states.)

The strength of a coalition comes from its size, not its homogeneity.

But maybe I'm wrong. In the era of social media, maybe cynicism beats optimism. Maybe the left is losing because it's bringing 20th-century strategies to 21st-century elections.

Look at the past eight years. Obama was charismatic. He presided over a [strong economy](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-jobs-recovery-may-not-be-flashy-but-its-strong/). He ended the unpopular [Iraq war](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/subjects/iraq/), and caught Osama Bin Laden. His administration was not involved in any major scandals. And yet Republicans were able to leverage anti-Obama rhetoric into massive electoral gains -- they control both houses of Congress, [trifectas](https://ballotpedia.org/Gubernatorial_and_legislative_party_control_of_state_government) in 25 states (compared to 4 for the Democrats), the presidency, and a [bonus SCOTUS seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland_Supreme_Court_nomination) to boot.

Such Republican dominance hasn't been seen [since the Civil War](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/18/republicans-build-on-their-dominance-in-state-legislatures.html) era.

[80% of marchers were in Obama/Clinton states](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-long-march-ahead-for-democrats/)

[Sen Booker says](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pol-womens-march-live-cory-booker-women-s-march-is-not-a-1485028604-htmlstory.html) "This is not a Democrat or Republican thing. This is actually something we can all unify around."

[Rep Barney Frank wrote in 1991:](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vqJJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Xg0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=4293,3641940&hl=en)

> His holier-than-thou attitude -- saying in a very loud voice that he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else -- really undercuts his effectiveness.

> To him, anyone who disagrees with him is a crook; there are no honest disagreements with people. Bernie's view of the world is that the great majority of people agree with him on all the issues and the only reason he does not win is that the Congress is crooked.

If opposition to Trump is (or appears) partisan, Trump wins in Congress. Rep Lewis's all-Democrat inauguration boycott presents the appearance of a unified GOP.

The march in DC [outnumbered](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/22/us/politics/womens-march-trump-crowd-estimates.html) the inauguration crowds the day before[^5].

[^5]: Comparing crowds in DC isn't quite fair, as Trump faces a home field disadvantage; he earned [only 4%](http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/district-of-columbia) of the vote there.
