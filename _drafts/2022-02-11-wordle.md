Based on an analysis of all legal words in [Wordle][wordle], the [best starting word][soare] is `SOARE`.
Or maybe, using [information theory][crane], it's `CRANE`.
An [economist recommends][slice] `SLICE` if you want to minimize the number of guesses, or `ADEPT` if you want to minimize your odds to fail.
I personally start with `RATIO`, since I get the feeling that the author avoids[^1] the letter `E` to keep things interesting.
All these big-brain takes raise the question: how much does it really matter?

[^1]: The letter `E` appears in far more possible solutions than any other letter. However, four other letters (`I`, `N`, `O`, and `R`) appeared in more Wordles in January 2022. On top of that, there was only a single puzzle (`PERKY`) where `E` was the only vowel, while each other vowel appeared on its own repeatedly (for example, `U` was the only vowel in `WRUNG`, `SLUMP`, and `TRUSS`).

To investigate, I put together a computer simulation of Wordle (source code [here][source]).
The first guess can be specified.
Each subsequent guess is chosen randomly, taking into account all past clues.
Essentially, the computer plays on hard mode[^2] and always goes with the first compatible guess that pops into its head.
By applying that strategy to thousands upon thousands of puzzles, we can get a sense for the importance of a good opening word.

[^2]: On Wordle, hard mode means you must use all yellow and green letters. The computer is actually more strict than that. It always uses green letters in that same place, always uses yellow letters in a different place, and never uses gray letters again. From an informal survey, many players seem to follow these same strict constraints.

*My code can generate and solve about a thousand random Wordle puzzles per minute on my laptop. And, because it uses the solutions list, it's pretty good about sticking to "real" words.*

Before we get into the results, a quick disclaimer.
Wordle has two word lists.
There's a list of possible solutions (2,300 words) and a list of allowed guesses (12,900 words).
The vast majority of "real" words are in the solutions list, while the [non-solution words][non_solutions] are mostly nonsense like `KYLIX` and `UMIAQ`.
In the interest of imitating human play patterns, the model only uses the solutions list.
The list of allowed guesses is ignored.

I ran each of the starting words from above through 40,000 simulated puzzles.
Then I did the same with a variety of other starting words for comparison: `ADIEU` (lots of vowels), `LYMPH` (no vowels), `GEESE` (duplicate vowels), `JERKY` (uncommon consonants), `FLUFF` (duplicate consonants), `MOIST` (funny), and `XYLYL` (possibly the [worst starting word][soare]).
Results are shown in the table below:

| First Guess | Win Rate (±0.5%) | Average Guesses (±0.02) |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-----------------------:|
| `ADEPT`     |         98.8%    |            3.92         |
| `ADIEU`     |         97.4%    |            4.02         |
| `CRANE`     |         98.5%    |            3.82         |
| `FLUFF`     |         97.4%    |            4.39         |
| `GEESE`     |         97.6%    |            4.21         |
| `JERKY`     |         96.9%    |            4.25         |
| `LYMPH`     |         98.8%    |            4.10         |
| `MOIST`     |         98.7%    |            3.92         |
| `RATIO`     |         98.0%    |            3.91         |
| `SLICE`     |         98.8%    |            3.84         |
| `SOARE`     |         97.9%    |            3.88         |
| `XYLYL`     |         95.7%    |            4.50         |

Our win rates have a statistical uncertainty of 0.5% in the table above.
That means that `ADEPT`, `CRANE`, `LYMPH`, `MOIST`, and `SLICE` are essentially tied for the top spot, while the rest are detectably worse.
But keep in mind, these precise numbers come from averaging over century's worth of puzzles for each word.
Percent-level differences won't be visible week-to-week, or even month-to-month.
Even over the course of a year, a 97% win rate will see about[^4] 5-11 losses, compared to 7-13 losses for a 98% win rate.
That means it's very possible for a "better" word to fail more often than a "worse" one, even over a significant period of time.

[^4]: When counting random events, statistical uncertainty goes as the [square root][sqrt_n] of the count. For example, a count of 100 puts your error bars at 90-110 while a count of 1,000,000 puts them at 999,000-1,001,000. If you want a lot of confidence, you need a lot of data!

Guess quality matters more when looking at the average number of guesses.
If you start every puzzle with `CRANE` or `SLICE`, you should average about 27 guesses per week.
You'll average about 29 guesses per week with `LYMPH`, and 31 with `FLUFF`.
After about a month, your sample size will be large enough to see those differences in your stats (see figure below).

If you want to optimize your Wordle stats over the course of a year, it's important to choose your opening guess carefully.
Good options include `CRANE` and `SLICE`.




By simulating thousands of Wordle puzzles, we can precisely compare opening words in terms of hard mode win rate and average guesses required.
The differences are pretty small.
And with only a single puzzle per day, our statistical sample size is small too.
That leaves a lot of room for luck.
If you're planning to play daily for months or even years, starting with `CRANE` or `SLICE` is a good way to optimize your stats.

But keep in mind that starting on `CRANE` doesn't mean you'll solve every puzzle in exactly 3.82 guesses.

Pretty much any "real" word (not `XYLYL`) has a win rate between 97% and 99%, meaning that bad luck and brain farts are probably responsible for more losses than inefficient word choice.

Some opening words are better than others in Wordle.
`CRANE` and `SLICE` are among the best, both in terms of maximizing win rate and minimizing the number of moves.
But with only a single puzzle per day, small-number statistics are a big problem.
Even a terrible starting word like `XYLYL` will often win every day for a month straight.
