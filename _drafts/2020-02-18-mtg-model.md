WOTC printed [[Scapeshift]] in 2008, [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut]] in 2009, and [[Primeval Titan]] in 2010. For eight years after that, they walked on eggshells to avoid further enabling land-based combo decks in Modern. As recently as 2018, fifty-six of the sixty cards in an [Amulet Titan main deck](https://www.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/articles/how-to-play-modern-amulet-titan-2nd-place-at-grand-prix-hartford/) were printed before the existence of Instagram[^1]. Design philosophy [finally changed](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/play-design-lessons-learned-2019-11-18) about a year ago, and WOTC seems to be making up for lost time. After eight years of drought, we got [[Arboreal Grazer]], [[Field of the Dead]], [[Castle Garenbrig]], [[Once Upon a Time]], and [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] all in the space of eight months.

[^1]: Instagram was launched in October 2010. Cards most commonly played alongside [[Primeval Titan]] in Modern include [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] (first printed in 2004), [[Sakura-Tribe Elder]] (2004), [[Farseek]] (2005), [[Simic Growth Chamber]] (2006), [[Search for Tomorrow]] (2006), [[Summoner's Pact]] (2007), [[Tolaria West]] (2007), [[Vesuva]] (2007), [[Prismatic Omen]] (2008), [[Explore]] (2009), [[Oracle of Mul Daya]] (2009), [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut]] (2009), [[Amulet of Vigor]] (February 2010), and [[Ancient Stirrings]] (April 2010).

One new card is exciting. Two is even better. But five new cards in quick succession can be overwhelming, especially for a synergy-driven deck like Amulet Titan. [[Field of the Dead:FOTD]] wants us to have more lands on the table, but half the point of bounce lands is that we can get to six mana with *fewer* lands. [[Castle Garenbrig]] works best when we play [[Breeding Pool]] over [[Gemstone Mine]], but that makes it harder to splash off-color sideboard cards. [[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]] took the place of colorless tools like [[Walking Ballista]], but without those tools it's not clear if [[Ancient Stirrings]] is worthwhile. Finding a balance between so many competing incentives takes hours upon hours of playtesting -- more time than we have to spare!

## Model

This is where the computer comes in. My numerical model[^2] can read in a deck list, [goldfish](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Goldfishing) thousands of games, and tell us exactly how reliably that deck can expect to cast [[Primeval Titan]] by turn three. The model doesn't know anything about sequencing or strategy. Instead, it tries all possible combinations of legal plays. This approach is computationally inefficient, but it's guaranteed to find the fastest way to win, even when faced with nontrivial choices.

[^2]: The code (written in Python) is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/charles-uno/mtg-model). Pull requests welcome!

For example, let's say we cast [[Once Upon a Time]] and see [[Forest]], [[Primeval Titan]], [[Simic Growth Chamber]], and two noncreature spells. An experienced player can generally eyeball the correct choice, but spelling out the decision explicitly for the computer is tedious and error-prone -- a calculation based on whether we already have an untapped land, whether we have a bounce land, how many green sources, whether we have an [[Amulet of Vigor]], whether we have a [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]], and so on. Instead of all that, the model just makes three copies of the game. The first copy takes [[Forest]], the second takes [[Primeval Titan]], and the third takes [[Simic Growth Chamber]], then they each progress independently from there. If any of the three copies finds a line to get [[Primeval Titan]] on the table by turn three, it's pretty safe to say a human player could have done the same. And the computer is *fast*. My laptop can simulate a hand in seconds. Running overnight, it can do thousands.

![Example Output](/assets/images/mtg-model-amulet-t3.png)
*The model thinks it has to sacrifice [[Castle Garenbrig]] to use the second ability. This makes some bookkeeping easier under the hood. There's no effect on the outcome, since the simulation ends as soon as we cast [[Primeval Titan]].*

The downside of brute force is that the computer essentially has superhuman "instincts" about the order of the deck. When a human player casts [[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]], they have to commit to a choice without knowing what their next card will be. The computer tries all options and keeps whichever works out best. Several corrections[^3] are included in the model to suppress non-human play patterns, but even so, the model includes a percent-level bias in favor of [[Ancient Stirrings]] and [[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]].

[^3]: To suppress non-human play patterns, the order of the deck is locked in as soon as the game begins. There are no mulligans. And any time the computer would search its deck for a card, instead it leaves the deck as-is and creates a new copy of that card out of thin air. This means no deck thinning, which introduces a small uncertainty (well under 1%).

## Questions

For the sake of brevity, we're not getting into the numbers for [[Once Upon a Time]] and [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]]. Both cards are so obviously powerful that they saw near-universal adoption as soon as they were available[^4]. Instead, we're looking at three questions that (according to [decklist aggregators](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/metagame/modern#paper)) remain unresolved:

[^4]: For a rundown of how [[Once Upon a Time]] and [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] shook up Amulet Titan, check out [this piece](http://magic.facetofacegames.com/how-theros-broke-amulet-titan/) by Daryl Ayers.

- [[Arboreal Grazer]] vs [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]]. [[Arboreal Grazer:Grazer]] ramps immediately, typically setting up three mana on turn two. On the other hand, [[Sakura-Tribe Scout:Scout]] can be activated multiple times. Which makes us more likely to cast [[Primeval Titan]] by turn three?
- [[Ancient Stirrings]] vs [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] vs [[Explore]]. Before [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]], the deck played [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] alongside either [[Ancient Stirrings]] or [[Explore]]. It's clear that [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove:Dryad]] belongs in the deck -- but what is it replacing?
- [[Castle Garenbrig]] vs [[Gruul Turf:Previous]] [[Gemstone Mine:Lands]]. [[Gemstone Mine]] is untapped on turn one, and taps for any color we need. [[Gruul Turf:Bounce lands]] are half the reason we play [[Amulet of Vigor:Amulet]] in the first place. Are we really coming out ahead if we cut those cards for [[Castle Garenbrig]]?

Simulations make use of the list below. The letter `X` represents [[Arboreal Grazer]] or [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]]; `Y` is [[Ancient Stirrings]], [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]], or [[Explore]]; and `Z` is either four [[Castle Garenbrig]] or two [[Gemstone Mine]] and two more [[Selesnya Sanctuary:bounce]] [[Gruul Turf:lands]].

Note that the above list does not include [[Cavern of Souls]] or [[Vesuva]] due to complexity. We're also not accounting for small variations between deck lists. Some people play [[Boros Garrison]], [[Crumbling Vestige]], a third [[Tolaria West]], and so on. Wiggle room in the mana base introduces a potential bias across the board, but should not affect our ability to make relative comparisons.

## Numbers

A year ago, we might have looked at the odds of casting [[Primeval Titan]] by turn four. [[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]] improves the deck's consistency to a point where that's no longer interesting. The table below focuses on turn three. Turn two, once the [stuff of legends](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-18-2016-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2016-01-18), is now within reach as well.

| X   | Y       | Z         | Turn 2 | Turn 3 |
|:----|:--------|:----------|:------:|:------:|
| AG  | AS      | Castle    | 3%     | 36%    |
| AG  | AS      | No Castle | 3%     | 32%    |
| AG  | Azusa   | Castle    | 4%     | 34%    |
| AG  | Azusa   | No Castle | 5%     | 34%    |

| STS | Explore | No Castle | 2%     | 34%    |

<p class="table-caption">Columns X, Y, and Z indicate different configurations of the deck listed in the previous section. Turn 2 numbers are odds of a random seven-card hand from that deck casting [[Primeval Titan]] by turn two. The final column is the odds of casting [[Primeval Titan:Titan]] by turn three (so turn two *or* turn three). All values ±1%.</p>

## Conclusions and Caveats

[[Castle Garenbrig]] makes Amulet Titan marginally[^5] less likely to win on turn two, but significantly more likely to win on turn three. On top of that, playing fewer bounce lands makes the deck less vulnerable to [[Assassin's Trophy]], [[Damping Sphere]], and [[Field of Ruin]]. [[Castle Garenbrig]] is a slam dunk for Amulet Titan.

[^5]: The statistical uncertainty is ±1%, so the difference between 2% and 3% is not significant on its own. But with several data points, we can see a trend.

[[Arboreal Grazer]] gives the deck a significant boost on turn two. [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]] appears to perform marginally better on turn three, but those numbers come with a grain of salt. The model assumes a non-interactive opponent.





In the wild, we have to worry about [[Fatal Push]], [[Lava Dart]], and even [[Pithing Needle]].










that [[Sakura-Tribe Scout:Scout]] always


It appears to perform marginally worse than [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]] on turn three, but let's take those numbers with a grain of salt.





[[Arboreal Grazer]] doubles the deck's odds of casting [[Primeval Titan]] on turn two.









Statistical uncertainty of 1%

Numbers are also sensitive to the exact mana base. If you swap -1 Breeding pool, +1 FOTD, all the turn three numbers drop by a percent or two. Comparison between STS and Grazer holds, but "40% of hands can land turn 3 titan" becomes a stretch.

Numbers are inflated for Ancient Stirrings because it knows the order of the deck. This is a percent-level effect. Table above shows Grazer/Stirrings/Castle slightly outperforming Grazer/Explore/Castle, but in fact it's probably the other way around. OUAT is affected as well. However, since OUAT is present in all lists, it shouldn't throw off our comparisons.




. This means all the numbers are biased up by a few percent.




Numbers above suggest that Stirrings edges out Explore, but in fact that's probably not the case.




Best estimate puts this effect at a few percent, meaning that Ancient Stirrings

In builds with Azusa, Castle is on par with extra bounce lands. Without Azusa, Castle is clearly better. Not only that, but it



Castle performs well across the board.

Grazer is twice as good at producing Primeval Titan on turn 2. Notably, Grazer makes it possible to land turn 2 titan with a single Amulet. Also notable that STS's numbers here are inflated. These simulations assume we always untap with it, but sometimes our non-goldfish opponent will have a Lightning Bolt or Fatal Push.

The selling point of STS is its ability to activate at instant speed. It can flash in a Bojuka Bog in response to Past in Flames, or a bounce land in response to Field of Ruin.

In my experience, that's not enough. Grazer makes the deck faster, can soak up damage against Burn or Infect, and doesn't care about opposing removal.





- Ancient Stirrings numbers are inflated by a few percent because of brute force. OUAT inflated as well, but that's true for all lists.
- Numbers for STS and Azusa are also inflated, since we assume creatures never die. Dryad inflated as well, but that's true of all lists.
- -1 breeding pool, +1 FOTD drops all the turn 3 numbers by 1% to 2%. sensitive to mana base, but true of all the lists.






[[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]] changed the game.


STS is significantly worse at making turn 2 titan. in particular, grazer makes it possible to turn 2 titan with a single amulet. not super likely, but every line helps!

For turn 3, AG and STS put up similar numbers. but keep in mind that the model assumes a non-interactive opponent. STS cast on turn 1 is guaranteed to be usable on turns 2 and 3.

Instant-speed interaction with bojuka bog, plus protecting bounce lands. vs ability to block and not caring about removal.

Castle comes out about even on turn 2, but is a small step up on turn 3 across the board.


Castle is better than no castle across the board. plus, when an opponent has instant-speed interaction, bounce lands can leave us with our pants down. castle not so much.

As for AS vs Azusa vs Explore, the numbers all look about the same.






Only look out to turn 3. Back in the day, we looked out to turn 4 for Valakut. But that's because the odds of getting a turn 3 titan in those days were pretty small.

Also, Amulet is way more computationally intensive.

The model knows how to transmute [[Tolaria West]], as well as how to play it as a land. It knows how to float mana and stack triggers when it has [[Simic Growth Chamber]] and multiple [[Amulet of Vigor:Amulets]]. It even knows how to [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]] for [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] on turn two, play its extra lands, then pay for the [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]] on turn three. Basically, it can figure out the same line a human player would, but faster. My laptop can simulate a game in a few seconds. Running overnight, it can simulate thousands.



https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sort_table.asp

Other than power level concerns, these changes are good! Get some of the weird stuff out of there. Shorten turns. Less mana floating, less shuffling, fewer extra land drops to keep track of. Feels more direct, less masturbatory

On its face, [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] ramps us from three lands to five. That seems a lot worse than [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]], who ramps from three to six. But if one of those lands is [[Castle Garenbrig]], it turns out five is all we need to cast [[Primeval Titan]]. On top of that, [[Castle Garenbrig:Castle]] always enters the battlefield untapped if we control [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove:Dryad]].

WOTC has printed more cards for Amulet Titan in the past eight months than in the previous eight years combined.

WAR gave us Grazer, the first real competition for STS in fifteen years
M20 printed FOTD, diversifying the threat base at minimal deckbuilding cost
MH1 had FOV, the best answer to Blood Moon we've ever seen
ELD printed both OUAT, the best cantrip we've ever seen
also Castle Garenbrig, a card tailor-made for Primeval Titan
Most recently, THB gave us Dryad, a knock-off Azusa that dominates the board in combination with Valakut
KGC was a short-lived alternate win condition

Synergy is complicated!

- OUAT displaces Karn/Trinket/Golos/EE/etc. Makes Stirrings worse. Stirrings ultimately gets cut
- Without [[Ancient Stirrings]], the deck is less likely to have [[Amulet of Vigor]]. Makes you want a higher land count to cast Titan the "fair" way.
- Castle displaces some number of bounce lands, making Amulet and Scout worse. Also makes us want to play more Forests. Cut Gemstone Mine for Breeding Pool.
- Field of the Dead and Valakut allow you to shave on Tolaria West
- Off-color bounce lands like [[Boros Garrison]] are awkward since Castle makes Titan cost 2GGG
- Hanweir Battlements doesn't give a power boost or vigilance, but you can pay for it with Valakut
- Castle also ramps by itself, making the double-ramp from Azusa less important. Dryad is almost as good.
- Dryad makes you want to have 3 mana on turn 2, which makes Grazer look better than Scout.
- Valakut lets the deck go over the top without double strike

Cards printed in 2019 were off the charts in terms of power level. 

Hogaak dominated Modern for months, even after the banning of Bridge from Below.

Oko has been banned from every format that doesn't allow dual lands.

WAR saw two cards restricted in Vintage; only two other sets in the Modern era share this dubious honor. Mental Misstep and Gitaxian Probe (NPH), Treasure Cruise and Dig Through Time (KTK)

Of the nine cards currently banned from Pioneer (which goes back to 2014), five were printed in 2019.
Not counting fetch lands. They were excluded to cut down on shuffling, rather than banned for power level.
