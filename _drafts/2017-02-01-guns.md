The NRA likes to claim, "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." It's complete malarkey: fewer than 1% of gun deaths in the US are justifiable homicides, and fewer than 1% of crimes are stopped by a law-abiding citizen with a gun.

Most firearm deaths have nothing to do with "bad guys." Of the 32k yearly gun deaths in this country, 20k are suicides. State-by-state, suicide rate corresponds strongly with gun ownership. Suicide is an impulsive act, and a nearby gun (unlike pills, etc) makes that act nearly certain to succeed.

Furthermore, of the 12k yearly gun homicides, 75% involve a killer who already knows the victim. Guns are used to escalate arguments and threaten intimates far more often than they are used to perpetrate random acts of crime or violence.

Children pay the price for America's obsession with guns. On average in the US, seven children are fatally shot (and another 20 are nonfatally shot) per day. The US makes up 25% of the population of the developed world, but accounts for 75% of children murdered with guns.
