Democrats are running Vice President Harris for president in 2024.
She's been by President Biden's side for the last four years and is his [hand-picked][biden_endorses_harris] successor.
Republicans are running former President Trump, who held the office from 2017 to 2021.
It's unusual to have a presidential election where both[^third_parties] candidates already know their way around the White House. 
This means we have the rare opportunity to make an apples-to-apples comparison between them. 
Skip the pearl-clutching about tweets, crimes[^crimes], and campaign drama. 
Between the current administration and the former, who did the job better?

[^third_parties]: Under a parliamentary system, like in the UK, there can be three or more viable political parties. They form coalitions to create a majority government. The Electoral College makes that nearly impossible in the USA. Credible politicians here stick to the two major parties, and third parties are a joke. For example, despite 30+ years of attempts, the Green Party has [never won any election][green_officeholders] for state or federal office. Jill Stein, the Green candidate for president, has a laughably weak résumé: she served one-and-a-half terms on city council. 
[^crimes]: [Trump was convicted][trump_conviction] of business fraud after leaving office. Not ideal, obviously, but history shows that sometimes a slimeball can be an effective president. Just look at [LBJ][lbj_slimeball] or [Bill Clinton][clinton_slimeball]. Better to judge Trump by the performance of his administration.

To be clear: this is a big question. 
The president runs a million-person bureaucracy, commands the most powerful military in history, sets the legislative agenda, and more. 
Each dimension of the job is important in its own way.
Cherry-picking wins and losses just doesn't do it justice. 

So let's be systematic. 
Below, we've broken down presidential responsibilities into a handful of categories. 
For each category, we can lay out the most impactful policies of each administration. 
This will allow us to judge not only the priorities of each administration, but also how effective it was at getting them done.

## COVID Response

**When the nation is shaken by a crisis, Americans look to the president for leadership and competence. Past presidents have been defined by their response of war, depression, and terrorism. The Trump and Biden/Harris administrations were faced with the worst pandemic in a century plus a global economic crisis.**

Trump signed the crisis response bills that Congress put on his desk. 
But his mismanagement of the pandemic also cost thousands of American lives. 

- Trump signed $3,200 billion for [vaccine development][trump_covid_vaccine_development], [paid leave][trump_covid_paid_leave], and [direct][trump_stimulus] [support][trump_additional_stimulus] for Americans and businesses. The spending passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. Trump himself was seemingly not involved.
- Trump also [undercut][trump_covid_mismanagement_analysis] the US pandemic response. He downplayed the severity of the virus, contradicted public health officials, elevated conspiracy theories, and discouraged precautions. The COVID death rate under Trump was very high compared to other wealthy nations, especially in [pro-Trump areas][covid_death_partisan_gap]. The estimated impact was [150,000][trump_covid_mismanagement_impact] preventable American deaths.
- On top of that, Trump impeded COVID response globally. He withdrew US membership from the [World Health Organization][trump_who] during the pandemic, along with $1 billion in funding. He also ran a propaganda campaign to [discourage vaccination][trump_covid_propaganda_china] in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

<!--
- Trump [delayed][trump_hurricane_maria_delay] $20 billion in federal aid to Puerto Rico after [Hurricane Maria][hurricane_maria] in 2017. His administration also blocked an investigation into the delay. Maria was among the most extreme hurricanes on record, killing 3,000 people and causing $100 billion in damage. There was no such delay when [Hurricane Harvey][hurricane_harvey] struck Texas that same year.
- George Floyd. Trump made some statements. PACT deployed federal law enforcement to disrupt protests. No identification, no approval from states.

-->

The Biden/Harris administration made COVID an immediate priority upon taking office, and it showed.

- Democrats [passed][bh_stimulus_bill] an additional $1,900 billion in stimulus spending along party lines. This made pandemic support in the US [more generous][g20_stimulus_comparison] that in most of Europe. Critics [worried][bh_stimulus_concerns] that so much spending would lead to massive inflation. In fact, the US saw a [faster recovery][post_covid_gdp] than any other wealthy nation: lower unemployment, less inflation, and faster GDP growth. [Wages are rising][wage_growth], especially for [low-income workers][low_income_wages]. Income inequality is [falling][income_inequality_falling]. 
- They promised 100 million vaccine doses in the first 100 days in office. Then they did it in [half that time][bh_100m_shots_100_days].
- They distributed 12 COVID tests per household, for free, [by mail][covid_tests_by_mail].
- They [donated][global_vaccines] 700 million vaccine doses globally.
- They also issued [official guidance][bh_covid_plan] for schools and workplaces during COVID. In particular, this guidance included recommendations for how and when to relax precautions as the pandemic wound down.

## Domestic Legacy

**The president does not write legislation. But as the head of government, it's their job to set the agenda and work with Congress to get it done. Laws signed by a president can impact Americans for decades after the president leaves office, as can the federal judges they nominate.**

Trump was not particularly effective at working with Congress. 
Like past Republicans, he nominated anti-abortion judges and signed a tax cut for the rich. 
But he had trouble getting traction for his personal priorities, such as infrastructure and a border wall.

- [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act][trump_tax_cuts] --- $1,500 billion tax cut which [mostly benefited the rich][trump_tax_cuts_analysis]. The onset of the pandemic makes it hard to judge the long-term effects, but [similar tax cuts][bush_tax_cut_analysis] in the past have not delivered economic growth. 
- Trump nominated [200+ federal judges][trump_judges_white_male], who will have the power to interpret and strike down laws for decades. His nominations created a conservative supermajority[^rbg] on the Supreme Court, allowing them to [overturn Roe v Wade][dobbs]. This had been a long-term goal of religious conservatives. Women in many states can no longer access abortions, [even in the case of emergencies][emergency_abortion_post_dobbs]. There has also been [collateral damage][dobbs_collateral_damage] to non-abortion healthcare.
- Trump faced off with Congress over funding for a border wall to reduce undocumented immigration[^6], resulting in a [35-day government shutdown][trump_wall_shutdown]. He ultimately secured [about][wall_funding_2018] [$5 billion][wall_funding_2019] from Congress, then redirected another $10 billion from elsewhere. By the end of his term he had built [50 miles of new wall][trump_wall_outcome] of the proposed 1,300 miles. 
- Trump met with leaders in Congress to negotiate an [infrastructure][trump_infrastructure] bill. No such bill was produced.

[^rbg]: Conservative justices usually time their retirements so that a conservative president can nominate their replacement, and vice versa. For better or worse, this preserves the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court. The court moved right under Trump because liberal justice [RBG][rbg] died and was replaced with a conservative.

[^6]: We have 10+ million immigrants living in the USA without documentation, with more showing up all the time. This issue is trotted out every election season because it sounds scary. It's mostly hot air. Undocumented immigrants grow the economy by working and spending. They [pay more in taxes][immigrants_good_for_economy] than they use in benefits. And they have a [lower crime rate][illegal_immigrant_low_crime] than native-born Americans.

The Biden/Harris administration was very effective at shepherding legislation through Congress. 
They got a big infrastructure bill. 
They got a big climate bill. 
They got a big manufacturing bill.
They got a gun safety bill.
And they got most of that with bipartisan support.

- [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law][bh_infrastructure_bill] (bipartisan) --- $1,200 billion to modernize roads, bridges, public transit, broadband, and so on. This had been a [long-term goal][obama_and_trump_infrastructure] for both parties. 
- [Inflation Reduction Act][ira] --- $500 billion for clean energy, the largest such investment in history. This spending was offset by an [estimated $700 billion][ira_cbo] in corporate tax hikes and IRS crackdowns on wealthy tax cheats. Biden/Harris convinced a coal baron to [blow up his own career][bh_ira_manchin] to cast the deciding vote.
- [CHIPs and Science Act][bh_chips] (bipartisan) --- $300 billion to strengthen domestic high-tech manufacturing and supply chains.
- [Safer Communities Act][bh_gun_control] (bipartisan) --- $10 billion for school safety, first responders, and crisis intervention programs. This bill also strengthened background checks and red flag rules. This was the first federal gun law in [30 years][gun_control_history]. 
- [Respect for Marriage Act][bh_marriage_bill] (bipartisan) --- Established protections for same-sex and interracial marriages in case the conservative Supreme Court majority overturns the 2015 marriage equality ruling (as they have [threatened][thomas_overturn_marriage] to do).
- [Juneteenth National Independence Day Act][juneteenth] (bipartisan) --- Added the first new federal holiday since 1983. Juneteenth celebrates enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation. 
- Biden/Harris negotiated a bipartisan [immigration reform bill][immigration_bill_2023] to combat drug smuggling and speed up the years-long asylum process. Republicans withdrew support for the bill at Trump's request.
- They nominated 200+ federal judges, including [one][bh_scotus] to the Supreme Court. These judges will have the power to interpret and strike down laws for decades. The judges are [mostly women][bh_lots_of_judges]. About half of them have previously worked as civil rights lawyers and public defenders. 

<!--
- IRA also capped insulin prices for seniors
- They passed the bipartisan [Electoral Count Reform Act][bh_electoral_reform] with updates and clarifications to the presidential election process. This law closes the loopholes that [Trump attempted to use in 2020 to overturn the election][trump_fake_electors].

## Global Leadership 

**The USA has been a major player on the world stage for the better part of a century. We are the main driver of lower [trade barriers][usa_globalized_trade] worldwide. We are the largest [funding source][un_funding] for UN humanitarian work. And ([for][war_against_isis] [better][houthi_strikes] [or][syria_strikes] for [worse][vietnam_war]) we have an enormous military with worldwide reach.

Trump's foreign policy was more nativist than any other president in living memory.
He walked away from multinational agreements.
He cut immigration and refugee resettlement.
He made broad use of tariffs to "win" at international trade.
And he supported the aggression of strongmen in Israel and Russia against their neighbors. 

- Trump signed $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to fend off aggression from Russia, but [blocked][trump_ukraine_scandal] its distribution. At Trump's suggestion, Republican legislators also [delayed aid to Ukraine][trump_ukraine_2024] for several months in 2024.
- Trump supported Israel, as all recent presidents have. He even helped [normalize relations][trump_abraham_accords] between Israel and several Arab states. But he also broke [past precedent][gwb_against_settlements_gaza_aid] with his disregard for Palestinian sovereignty. He [withdrew US support][trump_peace_plan] for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. He endorsed further [Israeli settlements][trump_peace_plan] on occupied land. He [halted humanitarian aid][trump_halted_aid] to Palestine. And he officially [recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel][trump_jerusalem][^5]. 
- Trump negotiated [updates to NAFTA][trump_nafta], the trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the USA. Among other changes, it improves working conditions and labor rights in Mexico. These changes will likely help American workers too, since they will no longer need to compete with such low wages. 
- He withdrew the US from [TPP][tpp], a trade deal meant to balance China's influence in the Pacific. He then imposed broad tariffs on imports from China in an attempt to shrink the US-China trade deficit. Retaliatory tariffs hit agricultural producers hard, necessitating a $28 billion bailout. The [cost][trump_china_trade_war_size] to [American consumers][trump_tariffs_size] was over $350 billion. GDP and job creation were also negatively affected. There was [no lasting impact][trump_trade_war_effects] to US-China trade patterns.
- Trump withdrew US support from the multinational [Iran Deal][trump_iran_deal] and reinstated US sanctions against Iran. These sanctions [destroyed Iran's economy][iran_deal_withdrawal_economy] and drove millions of Iranians into poverty. Iran has also [resumed uranium enrichment][iran_nuclear_material] and tripled its stockpile.
- Trump [negotiated][trump_taliban_negotiations] with the Taliban to set a timetable for American withdrawal from Afghanistan. He released 5,000 imprisoned Taliban fighters, reduced US troop levels from 13,000 to 2,500, and withdrew support from the elected Afghani government.

<!--
- He also imposed narrower tarrifs worldwide, including on our closest allies. 
- He withdrew US support from the [World Health Organization][trump_who] during the COVID pandemic. 
- He removed the US from the the [UN Human Rights Council][trump_un_hrc] and [UNESCO][trump_unesco]. 
- He [threatened to withdraw the US from NATO][trump_nato], but did not follow through.

[^5]: The status of Jerusalem is a long-standing obstacle to peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The city is culturally important to both sides. 

The Biden/Harris administration prioritized multinational coalitions to counter aggression from Russia and China. 
They also attempted to reduce US involvement in the Middle East, with mixed results.

- Biden/Harris led the international response to [Russia's invasion of Ukraine][bh_ukraine_leadership]. He signed [$175 billion][bh_ukraine_aid] in military and humanitarian aid. He also established [clear guardrails][bh_ukraine_guardrails] to prevent direct conflict between nuclear powers.
- They strengthened relationships with [Australia][bh_pacific_australia], [India][bh_pacific_india], [Japan][bh_pacific_japan_korea], [Papua New Guinea][bh_pacific_png], [the Phillipines][bh_pacific_phillipines], and [South Korea][bh_pacific_japan_korea] in order to counter aggressive behavior from China and North Korea. 
- They sent support to Israel after the October 2023 terrorist attack and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza[^4]. He also leveraged the close US-Israel relationship to pursue peace. He talked Israel back from the [water siege of Gaza][gaza_water_siege]. He brokered a [week-long ceasefire][gaza_ceasefire_2023] in November 2023, and is [pursuing another][ceasefire_work_2024]. He has repeatedly urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties, even threatening to [withhold arms][rafah_arms]. He built a [temporary port][gaza_port] off Gaza for faster delivery of humanitarian aid. And he's pushing for [Palestinian statehood][palestinian_statehood] as part of a postwar plan.
- Biden/Harris completed the withdrawal of US forces from [Afghanistan][afghanistan_withdrawal], ending 20 years of occupation. The Taliban attacked during the final stages of the withdrawal, killing 13 American soldiers and toppling the Afghani government.
- They all but ended the US [drone war in Yemen][yemen_drone_war]. There have been 4 strikes under the current administration (compared to 100+ under Trump).

## Executive Effectiveness 

**The president leads the executive branch of the federal government, which has over a million employees. They hand-select department heads and sign executive orders to steer priorities. Notably, these orders are often reversed as soon as the president leaves office.**

> TODO: trump blurb

- Trump made it more difficult to access [food stamps][trump_snap_cuts]. As a result, 700,000 low-income Americans lost benefits.
- Trump implemented a policy of [separating families at the border][family_separation] to deter asylum seekers. Thousands of children (including infants) were held in federal custody. A judge later ordered Trump to reunite the families, but doing so took years due to poor recordkeeping.
- Trump made several attempts to [sabotage Obamacare][trump_aca_mandate_repeal] such as repealing the individual mandate, defunding the enrollment website, and blocking subsidy payments. The number of uninsured Americans rose by [5 million][usa_uninsured_rate] from 2015 to 2018. 
- He also rolled back Obama-era regulations on [methane emissions][trump_methane_rollback] and [fuel efficiency][trump_car_emission_rollback]. These changes saved businesses an estimated $120 billion in compliance costs. New vehicles in 2026 will average 40 MPG instead of 47 MPG. That's about an extra $100 per vehicle per year in fuel costs.

## Constitutional Integrity

**The Constitution lays out the process for elections and the peaceful transfer of power. It's the foundation upon which the entire government is built. The president is sworn to uphold it.**

Trump brazenly and repeatedly put his own political power above his oath to the US Constitution.
If his attempted [soft coup][soft_coup] had been successful, it would have been the end of the republic.
Elections would be meaningless.
He would be dictator for life.

[soft_coup]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_coup

- Trump [fired][trump_fires_comey] the head of the FBI, seemingly to disrupt an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. A special counsel was appointed to follow up. The resulting [report][mueller_report] did not charge Trump with a crime, but also did not exonerate him. They found numerous contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials. They also showed that Trump repeatedly attempted to exert "undue influence" to disrupt the investigation. Several men were convicted of lying to the FBI and witness tampering. Trump later [pardoned][trump_pardons] them.
- As president, Trump [publicly asked][trump_ukraine_scandal] Ukraine and China to interfere in the 2020 election in his favor. He attempted to blackmail the Ukranian government into conducting a sham investigation by withholding military aid. Several members of the Trump administration have confirmed that the aid was withheld with the express goal of arranging a quid pro quo.
- Trump [baselessly denied][trump_big_lie] the legitimacy of his 2020 election loss, and attempted to overturn the results to remain in power. He called the top election official in Georgia and [pressured him to fabricate votes][ga_sos_call]. He recruited electors in seven states to submit [fraudulent results][trump_fake_electors]. And he [incited a mob][jan_6] to storm the capitol and disrupt the certification of his loss. He was impeached for doing so, but not convicted. [Hundreds of rioters][jan_6_convictions] have been convicted.

Trump's actions were unprecedented in American history.
Biden and Harris have done nothing remotely comparable.

- Obama and Biden left office without incident after Trump won the 2016 election. 
- As president, Biden/Harris passed [updates to the election process][bh_electoral_reform] to close the loopholes Trump attempted to exploit.
- The Biden/Harris administration appointed a [special counsel][bh_special_counsel] to investigate conspiracies around the 2020 election. Trump has been indicted, but the trial is unlikely to complete before the 2024 election.

## Summary

Biden/Harris was an effective center-left administration. 
They led the US comparatively smooth COVID recovery. 
They shepherded a slew of bipartisan bills through Congress.
They passed the largest-ever investment in clean energy. 
They ended the 20-year war in Afghanistan.
And they reaffirmed America's commitment to our global allies. 

On the other hand, Trump governed as a knee-jerk reactionary. 
He signed a tax cut for the rich, then couldn't get anything else through Congress.
He presided over the longest-ever federal government shutdown. 
He actively undermined the pandemic response of his own administration. 
He started, and lost, a trade war with China. 
He engaged in needless cruelty against asylum seekers and their children.
And, worst of all, he brazenly prioritized his own political power over his oath to the Constitution. 

Either Harris or Trump will be president next year.
Please vote to help ensure it's the better one.
