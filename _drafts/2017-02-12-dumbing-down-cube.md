It's 2005, and we're playing Kamigawa-era Standard. I attack you with my <a class="card">Savannah Lions</a>, and you block with your <a class="card">Sakura-Tribe Elder</a>.

If you're a fluent player,



The elder shows up to fight the lion, throws a punch. Before the punch lands, he bails to plant a garden. But the punch still lands and knocks out the lion. 





, put damage on the stack, then sacrifice the elder -- killing my lions and also getting yourself a land.

> The basic rules don't talk about the steps of combat. Comprehensive rules are over 200 pages.

The *Magic 2010* rules update put an end to those kinds of shenanigans by taking damage off the stack. Since then, when you block my lions with your elder, you have to make a choice. You can kill the lions, or you can get yourself a land, but you can't do both.

<!--
At the time, this change was decried as "dumbing down the game," but that objection conflates the complexity of a game's strategy with the complexity of its rules. In fact, history's best games -- Backgammon, Chess, Go, Poker, etc -- demonstrate that a game with deep, engaging strategy need not be burdened with layers of bookkeeping.
-->

I don't remember having strong opinions at the time, but in hindsight I think the rules change was clearly correct. Stacking damage didn't make the game more fun, more interesting, or more skill-intensive.




It was just one more rule that new players had to learn before becoming fluent.

<!-- hoop to jump through -->

I recently got to wondering how many more layers of bookkeeping could be stripped away from *Magic*, without sacrificing the game's strategic depth, or the feel of its gameplay.

For a long time, I've been skeptical about Equipment in Magic. Flavor wise, if I'm powerful enough to summon armies and meteor storms, why am I micromanaging which guy is holding which sword? Mechanically, equipment does about the same thing as +1/+1 counters or auras, but adds another layer of rules to a game that is already very complicated.

From there, I have been wondering, how many layers of rules can you cut out and still have the game feel like Magic? The last iterations of uncommons cube had no equipment, no auras, no -1/-1 counters, no transform, no tutors, and it still felt 100% like Magic.

I think playing Star Realms kicked my thinking up a level. I want to try being MUCH more aggressive about slimming down the game.

Like...

No artifacts or enchantments. The only thing you summon is creatures, so all board effects can be blown up with damage. There's no minigame where you try to match up specific removal to specific threats.

No deck searching, even for lands -- shuffling is too slow. Maybe even no deck manipulation: scry, cascade, etc. Decks are for drawing and milling.

No upkeep or end step triggers. Actually, you know what, how about no upkeep or end step shenanigans at all:

Nothing at instant speed. No instants, no flash, no activated abilities (except mana abilities). Play on your own turn. Combat doesn't need combat tricks to be interesting. Limited is fun despite rarely playing counterspells.

To be clear, I'm not changing the rules. But by limiting card selection I'm making a lot of rules moot.

I have been skeptical for a long time of Equipment's place in *Magic*.

Flavor-wise:

- Snakes wearing boots and swinging swords, etc.
- I'm summoning entire armies. Shouldn't I have better things to do than micromanage which soldier is using which sword?

Mechanically:

- Two costs makes it twice as hard to dial in the appropriate power level.
- Adds complexity, but does it actually make the game more enjoyable?
- Complexity creep -- referring both to board state and to the learning curve for the game.

In my uncommons cube (2009-2015), I experimented with cutting a lot of things. Tried no auras. No equipment. No -1/-1 counters. Cut it down to four colors (no red, then no white).  

Even when things get cut, the game still feels like *Magic*. Equipment probably less important than most.

New cube -- interested in keeping it simple. Not particularly inclined to put equipment back in.

But why stop there? I have complete freedom over the contents of the cube. How simple can things be while still being *Magic*?

---

Remember Portal? It was boring *Magic*, but definitely still *Magic*. No equipment. No auras. No combat tricks or counterspells (with exceptions).

In some ways, at least to me, this feels more like *Magic* than what I play normally... there's no draw-go, no shenanigans on end step, no rules lawyering.

MaRo pointed out when damage came off the stack -- it's not dumbing down the game. It's actually making it more skill-intensive.

Old way: Savannah Lions attacks into your Sakura-Tribe Elder. You put damage on the stack then sacrifice. New way: you have to choose if you want to kill the lions or if you want the land.

Choosing between two real options rather than knowing the correct rules loophole.

How much can be stripped out?

Developers of Star Realms considered this question. They made a whole new game which resembles *Magic* in some ways.

Let's take some inspiration from them. Don't actually touch the rules -- we're still playing **Magic** -- but make card selections in a way that we care about relatively little of the rulebook.

Everything as simple as possible, but no simpler. Make sure we don't make the game uninteresting!

Note that WOTC already does this to some degree.

Usually a block (all drafted together) will emphasize +1/+1 counters OR equipment OR auras. In SOM, with -1/-1 counters, there were no cards in the whole block which made +1/+1 counters.

---

No auras or equipment -- let +1/+1 counters fill that role.

No -1/-1 counters -- let's be unambiguous about what dice mean on a creature.

No upkeep triggers -- let's just pretend the upkeep step doesn't exist.

getting a bit extreme...

No artifacts or enchantments. The game is about resources (lands), immediate effects (sorceries), and ongoing effects (creatures). Let's get rid of the minigame where I play Moat and you have to hope to draw your Disenchant (which has no purpose other than to kill Moat).

Planeswalkers pass this test -- but they are clearly not a core part of the game. Limited is *Magic*, and has essentially zero of them.

That's something I really like about Star Realms. The same sort of attacks that hit the opponent can also be directed to blow up their stuff. There's no minigame of specific classes of removal.

getting VERY extreme...

No instants. No flash. No instant-speed activated abilities (except mana abilities).

Basically, you play out your turn. No pausing when you go to combat. No combat tricks. No end step shenanigans. You draw, you play your turn, and you pass it back. The only thing your opponent does on your turn (other than sometimes resolve triggers) is assign blockers.

No scrying or other library manipulation. No searching. You shuffle your deck once at the start, and it remains shuffled.

---

Combat is still interesting because spells can still be cast before or after.

Chump blocking and gang blocking are still a thing. You can't get blown out by a trick, but you still have to make hard choices.

They attack a little guy into your big guy. Are they trying to soften him up for the burn spell in their hand, since they have no other answer? Or are they trying to bluff through a little bit of damage?

Haste becomes very powerful.
