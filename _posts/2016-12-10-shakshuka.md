Preheat the oven to <span class="metric">200C</span><span class="imperial">400F</span>. Or -- if you roasted[^2] your own tomatoes and/or peppers -- leave it on.

[^2]: You can roast peppers and tomatoes [yourself](/farm-freezer)! For peppers: Cut them in half and remove the seeds and stems. Bake face-down for about an hour at <span class="metric">200C</span><span class="imperial">400F</span>, until the skin blackens and puffs up. Allow to cool, then remove the skin. For tomatoes: Halve and bake face-up at <span class="metric">200C</span><span class="imperial">400F</span> until reduced by half and caramelization is visible. For large tomatoes, this may take over an hour.

Start the onions and some olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet. Cook them on medium heat until they caramelize to a deep brown. Stir them occasionally and add more olive oil if any corners start to scorch. Caramelizing the onions may take half an hour or more -- it's worth it!

Add the peppers and the spices. Stir completely into the onions. Everything should smell amazing. Then add the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, stirring intermittently, then turn the heat down to low.

Give the sauce a final stir, then add the feta cheese cubes. Press them gently into the sauce. They should be about uniformly spaced. Then use a spoon to hollow six craters into the sauce and crack an egg into each. Turn off the range and promptly move the skillet into the oven.

Bake uncovered until the egg whites are just set, about fifteen minutes. It can be difficult to judge by eye, so you can use a knife or chopstick to gently probe the eggs -- just be sure not to break the yolks. Serve immediately with pita or crusty bread. Makes six servings.

Note that the tomato sauce reheats well, but the eggs don't. It's better to fry a fresh egg in the morning and put that on top!
