Step up with markdown

Wysiwyg is terrible

Basically creating a website

Zip of html

Sensible defaults




I spend a pretty significant fraction of my life dealing with plain text, whether it be coding for work, coding for fun, or volunteer coding.

copy-paste something and it carries over exactly

type it out and it works. no invisible formatting
click and drag
