In many ways, carrying a pregnancy to term is like donating a kidney.
For the donor, the procedure is an inconvenience.
Post-op recovery lasts [about a month][donor_recovery], and after that there are generally no ill effects.
Kidney donors have about the same [life expectancy][kidney_life_expectancy] as the general public, and fatal complications are rare[^1].
For the recipient, on the other hand, it's a matter of life and death.
[Thousands of Americans die each year][donation_stats] due to a shortage of organ donors.




[^1]: The mortality rate for kidney donors is between [7 per 100k][kidney_mortality_1] and [31 per 100k][kidney_mortality_2], depending on how you count. For comparison, the rate of fatal pregnancy complications is about [17 per 100k][pregnancy_mortality].

Despite the stakes, organ donation is [strictly voluntary][donation_requires_consent].
The government never mandates donation --- even to save the life of a child, even if you are the only possible donor, even if you have died and aren't using your organs anymore!
Bodily autonomy is too important.





A first-trimester fetus can't survive outside the womb.
Terminating the pregnancy dooms the fetus

Terminating a pregnancy dooms the fetus, just as withholding an organ dooms a prospective recipient.



[donation_requires_consent]: https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-organ-donation/fact-check-clarifying-organ-donations-idUSL2N2L22WH



Even so, organ donation is never mandatory --- even after death!

Compulsory

Bodily autonomy is too important.

It's even illegal to harvest organs from a corpse

We don't even allow mandatory organ donation after death


It's illegal in all 50 states to harvest organs from a corpse, even to save the life of a child, unless they volunteered to be an organ donor before dying.





In many ways, carrying a pregnancy to term is like donating a kidney.
It's remarkably safe.
Only about 0.02% of pregnancies and kidney donations result in a fatal complication.

And, for the fetus or kidney recipient, it's a matter of life and death.
Terminating a pregnancy kills the fetus.
Thousands of Americans --- including children --- die every year waiting for a transplant.





About 0.02% of pregnancies result in fatal complications. The number is similar for kidney donors.




Donating a kidney is remarkably safe.
The risk of death from complications is about one in five thousand.
For comparison, that's about the same as an American's yearly risk of dying in a car accident

Kidney donors have the same life expectancy as the general public.






Thousands of Americans die each year waiting for a kidney transplant.
Every kidney donated saves a life.
And donating a kidney is no more dangerous than carrying a pregnancy to term:

- Life expectancy
- Risk of death from complications
- Physical cost in the short term







It's illegal to harvest blood or organs from a corpse, even to save the life of a child. As long as that remains true, any law restricting abortion is absurd on its face. Even if you believe that a fetus is a literal baby (more on that below) a pregnant woman certainly deserves as much bodily autonomy as a corpse.


Abortion law in TN assumes guilt. Doctors have to mount an affirmative defense that the procedure was necessary. Chilling effect.

In the US, about 1% of abortions take place after 20 weeks gestation. Third-trimester abortion (after 26 weeks) almost never happen.

Half of all conceptions are naturally aborted, usually before the woman even knows she's pregnant. If anyone truly believed life begins at conception, there would be resources here.

TODO: Estimate of rates before roe v wade

Catholic church tolerates abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy. Fetus grows in the fallopian tube instead of the womb. Dangerous for both -- but there are recorded cases of both surviving birth. Scholarly tradition. They have to admit that biology is complicated.

"life begins at conception" has trouble with TWINS
