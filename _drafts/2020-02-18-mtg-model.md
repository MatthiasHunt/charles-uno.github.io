WOTC printed [[Scapeshift]] in 2008, [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut]] in 2009, and [[Primeval Titan]] in 2010. For eight years after that, they walked on eggshells to avoid further enabling land-based combo decks in Modern. As recently as 2018, fifty-six of the sixty cards in an Amulet Titan main deck were printed before the existence of Instagram[^1]. Design philosophy [finally changed](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/play-design-lessons-learned-2019-11-18) about a year ago, and WOTC seems to be making up for lost time. After eight years of drought, we got [[Arboreal Grazer]], [[Field of the Dead]], [[Castle Garenbrig]], [[Once Upon a Time]], and [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] all in the space of eight months. 

[^1]: Instagram was launched in October 2010. Cards most commonly played alongside [[Primeval Titan]] in Modern include [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] (first printed in 2004), [[Sakura-Tribe Elder]] (2004), [[Farseek]] (2005), [[Simic Growth Chamber]] (2006), [[Search for Tomorrow]] (2006), [[Summoner's Pact]] (2007), [[Tolaria West]] (2007), [[Vesuva]] (2007), [[Prismatic Omen]] (2008), [[Explore]] (2009), [[Oracle of Mul Daya]] (2009), [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Valakut]] (2009), [[Amulet of Vigor]] (February 2010), and [[Ancient Stirrings]] (April 2010). 

One new card is exciting. Two is even better. But five new cards in quick succession can be overwhelming, especially for a synergy-driven deck like Amulet Titan. [[Field of the Dead:FOTD]] wants us to have more lands on the table, but half the point of bounce lands is that we can get to six mana with *fewer* lands. [[Castle Garenbrig]] works best when we play [[Breeding Pool]] over [[Gemstone Mine]], but that makes it harder to splash off-color sideboard cards. [[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]] took the place of colorless tools like [[Walking Ballista]], but without those tools it's not clear if [[Ancient Stirrings]] is worthwhile. Finding a balance between so many competing incentives takes hours upon hours of playtesting -- more time than we have to spare!

## Model

This is where the computer comes in. My numerical model[^3] can read in a deck list, [goldfish](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Goldfishing) thousands of games, and tell us exactly how reliably that deck can expect to cast [[Primeval Titan]] by turn three. The model doesn't know anything about sequencing or strategy. Instead, it tries all possible combinations of legal plays. This approach is computationally inefficient, but it's guaranteed to find the fastest way to win, even when faced with nontrivial choices.

[^3]: The code (written in Python) is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/charles-uno/mtg-model). Pull requests welcome!

For example, let's say we cast [[Once Upon a Time]] and see [[Forest]], [[Primeval Titan]], [[Simic Growth Chamber]], and two noncreature spells. An experienced player can generally eyeball the correct choice, but spelling out the decision explicitly for the computer is tedious and error-prone -- a calculation based on whether we already have an untapped land, whether we have a bounce land, how many green sources, whether we have an [[Amulet of Vigor]], whether we have a [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]], and so on. Instead of all that, the model just makes three copies of the game. The first copy takes [[Forest]], the second takes [[Primeval Titan]], and the third takes [[Simic Growth Chamber]], then they each progress independently from there. If any of the three copies (or their children) finds a line to get [[Primeval Titan]] on the table by turn three, it's pretty safe to say a human player could have done the same.

The model knows how to transmute [[Tolaria West]], as well as how to play it as a land. It knows how to float mana and stack triggers when it has [[Simic Growth Chamber]] and multiple [[Amulet of Vigor:Amulets]]. It even knows how to [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]] for [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] on turn two, play its extra lands, then pay for the [[Summoner's Pact:Pact]] on turn three. Basically, it can figure out the same line a human player would, but faster. On my laptop, simulating a single hand takes a few seconds. Running overnight, it can simulate thousands.

![Example Output](/assets/images/mtg-model-amulet-t3.png)
*The model thinks it has to sacrifice [[Castle Garenbrig]] to use the second ability. This makes some bookkeeping easier under the hood. There's no effect on the outcome, since the simulation ends as soon as we cast [[Primeval Titan]].*

The big caveat is shuffling. The computer attempts all possible options in parallel until it finds a winning line. Sometimes that means casting [[Summoner's Pact]] on upkeep to shuffle and blind-draw into a better card. Essentially, the brute force algorithm gives the computer superhuman "instincts" about the order of the deck. To suppress non-human play patterns, the order of the deck is locked in as soon as the game begins. There are no mulligans. And any time the computer would search its deck for a card, instead it leaves the deck as-is and creates a new copy of that card out of thin air. This means no deck thinning, which introduces a small[^4] uncertainty.

[^4]: [[Scapeshift]] decks thin about one land from the deck each turn. If we simulate out to turn five, that comes out to a 1% systematic uncertainty. Amulet decks don't do much searching in the first few turns of the game, so the effect is even smaller.

## Questions

For the sake of brevity, we're not getting into the numbers for [[Once Upon a Time]] and [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]]. Both cards are so obviously powerful that they saw near-universal adoption as soon as they were available. Instead, we're looking at three questions that (according to [decklist aggregators](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/metagame/modern#paper)) remain unresolved:

- [[Arboreal Grazer]] vs [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]]. [[Arboreal Grazer:Grazer]] ramps immediately, typically setting up three mana on turn two. On the other hand, [[Sakura-Tribe Scout:Scout]] can be activated multiple times. Which makes us more likely to cast [[Primeval Titan]] by turn three?
- [[Ancient Stirrings]] vs [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] vs [[Explore]]. Before [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]], the deck played [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]] alongside either [[Ancient Stirrings]] or [[Explore]]. It's clear that [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove:Dryad]] belongs in the deck -- but what is it replacing?
- [[Castle Garenbrig]] vs [[Gruul Turf:Previous]] [[Gemstone Mine:Lands]]. [[Gemstone Mine]] is untapped on turn one, and taps for any color we need. [[Gruul Turf:Bounce lands]] are half the reason we play [[Amulet of Vigor:Amulet]] in the first place. Are we really coming out ahead if we cut those cards for [[Castle Garenbrig]]?

Simulations make use of the following list:

<div class="deck-wrapper">
    <div class="deck-column">
        4 X<br>
        4 Y<br>
        4 [[Amulet of Vigor]]<br>

        4 [[Once Upon a Time]]<br>
        4 [[Primeval Titan]]<br>
        4 [[Summoner's Pact]]<br>
        2 [[Pact of Negation:Other]] [[Engineered Explosives:Stuff]]<br>
    </div>
    <div class="deck-column">
        4 Z<br>
        3 [[Misty Rainforest:Fetches]] and [[Breeding Pool:Shocks]]<br>
        4 [[Forest:Basic]] [[Snow-Covered Forest:Forests]]<br>
        3 [[Selesnya Sanctuary:Off-Color]] [[Golgari Rot Farm:Bounce]] [[Gruul Turf:Lands]]<br>
        6 [[Bojuka Bog:Off-Color]] [[Field of the Dead:Tapped]] [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle:Lands]]<br>
        4 [[Ghost Quarter:Off-Color]] [[Radiant Fountain:Untapped]] [[Hanweir Battlements:Lands]]<br>
        4 [[Simic Growth Chamber]]<br>
        2 [[Tolaria West]]<br>
    </div>
</div>

Where `X` is [[Arboreal Grazer]] or [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]]; `Y` is [[Ancient Stirrings]], [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]], or [[Explore]]; and `Z` is four [[Castle Garenbrig]] or two [[Gemstone Mine]] and two more [[Selesnya Sanctuary:bounce]] [[Gruul Turf:lands]].

Model focuses on Amulet Titan. Dedicated Valakut decks have more or less fallen off the radar, and so-called Titan Field decks don't seem to have quite found their footing.



One new card is exciting. Two is even better. But five new cards can be overwhelming, especially for a deck as synergistic as Amulet Titan. 



On its face, [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] ramps us from three lands to five. That seems a lot worse than [[Azusa, Lost but Seeking:Azusa]], who ramps from three to six. But if one of those lands is [[Castle Garenbrig]], it turns out five is all we need to cast [[Primeval Titan]]. On top of that, [[Castle Garenbrig:Castle]] always enters the battlefield untapped if we control [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove:Dryad]].


By the time we'd optimized our decks around [[Once Upon a Time]] and [[Castle Garenbrig]], [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] was at our doorstep. And we still hadn't made up our minds about [[Arboreal Grazer]]! 




[[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]] made the deck better when it took the place of [[Walking Ballista]], but it also made [[Ancient Stirrings]] worse.

[[Castle Garenbrig:Castle]] pushes us to play [[Breeding Pool]] over [[Gemstone Mine]]; now it's hard to splash off-color sideboard cards.

[[Once Upon a Time:OUAT]] took the place of colorless spells like [[Walking Ballista]]; [[Ancient Stirrings]] ended up on the chopping block as a result.

[[Field of the Dead:FOTD]] pushes us to play differently-named bounce lands rather than a set of [[Gruul Turf]].

Between the two, we can no longer reliably splash off-color sideboard cards.

[[Castle Garenbrig]] essentially allows us to cast [[Primeval Titan:Titan]] for 2GGG rather than 4GG, so green sources become more important.

Just take a look at [Amulet Titan, circa 2018](https://www.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/articles/how-to-play-modern-amulet-titan-2nd-place-at-grand-prix-hartford/). 

Other than a few one-offs, every card in the deck is older than [[Primeval Titan]] itself.

https://www.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/articles/how-to-play-modern-amulet-titan-2nd-place-at-grand-prix-hartford/



WOTC has printed more cards for Amulet Titan in the past eight months than in the previous eight years combined.

With the exception of a few singletons like [[Radiant Fountain]] and [[Walking Ballista]], every card in 2018 Amulet Titan was printed before 2010.


Other than the occasional [[Walking Ballista:tutor]] [[Reclamation Sage:target]] or [[Radiant Fountain:utility]] [[Cavern of Souls:land]], [Amulet Titan decks in 2018](https://www.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/articles/how-to-play-modern-amulet-titan-2nd-place-at-grand-prix-hartford/) were built out of cards printed before the existence of Instagram.


> Alternatively: "cards printed back when Harry Potter books were still coming out," "cards printed before Lady Gaga wore a dress made of meat."

[Design philosophy changed](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/play-design-lessons-learned-2019-11-18) in late 2018. WOTC ramped up the power level of cards printed into Standard-legal sets. Some of the new cards were powerful enough to make the jump to Modern. After eight years of drought, Titan players got [[Arboreal Grazer]], [[Field of the Dead]], [[Once Upon a Time]], [[Castle Garenbrig]], and [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]] all in the space of eight months.


- OUAT displaces Karn/Trinket/Golos/EE/etc. Makes Stirrings worse. Stirrings ultimately gets cut
- Without [[Ancient Stirrings]], the deck is less likely to have [[Amulet of Vigor]]. Makes you want a higher land count to cast Titan the "fair" way.
- Castle displaces some number of bounce lands, making Amulet and Scout worse. Also makes us want to play more Forests. Cut Gemstone Mine for Breeding Pool.
- Field of the Dead and Valakut allow you to shave on Tolaria West
- Off-color bounce lands like [[Boros Garrison]] are awkward since Castle makes Titan cost 2GGG
- Hanweir Battlements doesn't give a power boost or vigilance, but you can pay for it with Valakut
- Castle also ramps by itself, making the double-ramp from Azusa less important. Dryad is almost as good.
- Dryad makes you want to have 3 mana on turn 2, which makes Grazer look better than Scout.
- Valakut lets the deck go over the top without double strike

They've been printing cards so fast, it's tough to know what to do with them.

Inundated with new options. Faster than we can figure out what to do with them.

OUAT was so powerful that we barely noticed Castle Garenbrig.

By the time we found a place for Castle, they'd printed Dryad.

And there's still no consensus on whether Grazer is a suitable replacement for STS!

Other than a bit of turbulence in the Modern format, the past year has been nothing but good news for Amulet Titan players. 

WAR gave us Grazer, the first real competition for STS in fifteen years. M20 printed FOTD, diversifying the threat base at minimal deckbuilding cost. MH1 had FOV, the best answer to Blood Moon we've ever seen. 
ELD printed both OUAT, the best cantrip we've ever seen, as well as Castle Garenbrig, a card tailor-made for Primeval Titan. Most recently, THB gave us Dryad, a knock-off Azusa that dominates the board in combination with Valakut. 
KGC was a short-lived alternate win condition

WOTC banned Faithless Looting and Mox Opal, both long-time format staples.

Cards printed in 2019 were off the charts in terms of power level. 

Hogaak dominated Modern for months, even after the banning of Bridge from Below.

Oko has been banned from every format that doesn't allow dual lands.

WAR saw two cards restricted in Vintage; only two other sets in the Modern era share this dubious honor. Mental Misstep and Gitaxian Probe (NPH), Treasure Cruise and Dig Through Time (KTK)

Of the nine cards currently banned from Pioneer (which goes back to 2014), five were printed in 2019.
Not counting fetch lands. They were excluded to cut down on shuffling, rather than banned for power level.

Arboreal Grazer is the first real competition for Sakura-Tribe Scout since its printing in 2005.
