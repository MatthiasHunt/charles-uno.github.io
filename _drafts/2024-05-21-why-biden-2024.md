For the first time in nearly a century, both[^1] candidates for president have already held the office. 
This gives us the rare opportunity to ignore the campaign bluster and ask directly: who was better at the job?

I believe the answer is Biden, and I don't believe it's close.
His priorities are better.
He is more effective at enacting them.
You can check my work below.

[^1]: Under a parliamentary system, like in the UK, there can be three or more viable political parties. Parties form coalitions to create a majority government. The Electoral College makes that nearly impossible in the US. Credible politicians in the USA stick to the two major parties, and third parties are a joke. For example, despite 30+ years of attempts, the Green Party has [never won *any* election for state or federal office][green_officeholders]. Jill Stein, the Green candidate for president, has a laughably weak résumé: she served one and a half terms on city council.

## Signature Legislation

Biden passed several significant bills despite a fifty-fifty tie in the Senate:

- [American Rescue Plan][arp] - $1,900 billion COVID stimulus. 
- [Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act][iija] (bipartisan) - $1,200 billion to modernize roads, bridges, broadband, public transit, etc.
- [Inflation Reduction Act][ira] - $500 billion for clean energy, the largest such investment in history. This spending was offset by an [estimated $700 billion][ira_cbo] in corporate tax hikes and IRS crackdowns on wealthy tax cheats.
- [CHIPs and Science Act][chips] (bipartisan) - $300 billion for domestic high-tech manufacturing and supply chains.
- [Safer Communities Act][biden_gun_control] (bipartisan) - $10 billion for school safety, first responders, crisis intervention programs, etc. This bill also expanded background checks, red flag rules, etc. It's the first gun safety law in nearly 30 years.

Trump had a larger majority in Congress than Biden, but he did less with it:

- [CARES Act][cares] (bipartisan) - $2,200 billion COVID stimulus.
- [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act][tcja] - $1,500 billion in tax cuts which [mostly benefited high-income households and corporations][tcja_impact].

## Israel and Palestine

Hamas has been engaged in "[asymmetric warfare][hamas_goals]" against Israel for decades: [suicide bombers][wiki_hamas], [human shields][hamas_tunnels_not_bunkers], [sexual violence][hamas_rape], etc. 
Last October saw Hamas's largest attack yet: 1,000+ Israelis killed and hundreds more taken hostage.
Israel responded by invading Gaza to eradicate Hamas.
The civilian toll has been catastrophic: [tens of thousands dead][gaza_casualties], more at risk of starvation, infrastructure in ruins.
It's a humanitarian crisis.

Biden is trying to strike a balance:

- On one hand, Biden has Israel's right to defend itself.
  Israel is a long-standing US ally and they just suffered a terrorist attack on the scale of 9/11.
  Biden sent billions of dollars in arms.
  He also vetoed some stern letters from the UN because they were not sufficiently critical of Hamas.
- On the other, he has the civilians in Gaza. 
  Biden brokered a [ceasefire in November][gaza_ceasefire_2023], and is [pursuing another][ceasefire_work_2024].
  He has repeatedly urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties, even threatening to [withhold arms][rafah_arms].
  He [built a temporary port][gaza_port] off Gaza for faster delivery of humanitarian aid. 
  He's pushing for [Palestinian statehood][palestinian_statehood] as part of a postwar plan.

I think his balance is off.
He should have been quicker to draw the [red line][rafah_arms].
But let's be clear-eyed about the alternative.
Trump's record on Palestine is horrific, and shows no interest in balance:

- Trump [withdrew US support][trump_peace_plan] for a two-state solution. 
- Trump endorsed further [Israeli settlements][trump_peace_plan] on occupied land.
- Trump [halted humanitarian aid][trump_halted_aid] to Gaza.
- Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing decades of precedent. The status of Jerusalem is a long-standing obstacle to peace.
- Trump blocked [immigration][trump_muslim_ban] and [refugee resettlement][trump_refugees] from Muslim nations.

## Russia and Ukraine

Ukraine ousted its pro-Russian president in 2014. 
[Russia invaded and annexed][russia_ukraine_war] the Crimea region soon after, and supported pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region.
In 2022, Russia launched a full invasion. 
Russia continues to occupy Ukranian land.

- Biden has signed [$175 billion][biden_ukraine_aid] in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, while also setting [clear guardrails][biden_ukraine_guardrails] to prevent direct conflict between nuclear powers.
- Trump [blocked $400 million of military aid][trump_ukraine_scandal] to Ukraine that had been allocated for Ukraine, then tried to blackmail Ukraine into fabricating dirt on his political opponents. He was impeached (though acquitted) for doing so. 
- At Trump's suggestion, Republican legislators also [delayed aid to Ukraine][trump_ukraine_2024] for several months in 2024.

## Age

Biden is older than dirt.
Second term comes with a decent risk of a major health complication

- Kamala Harris is competent. Ideologically similar to Biden. Has been deeply involved in the administration's major accomplishments.
- Still seems pretty sharp. Sometimes misspeaks (potentially related to a lifelong stutter). But listen to recent interviews and speeches. He's sharp. He knows what's going on. 

- Democrats held a primary to decide whether or not to replace Biden with an "average Democrat". Dean Phillips was a perfectly respectable choice: 55 years old, successful businessman, three terms in the House of Representatives, successfully flipped a red district.

[dean_phillips]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Phillips

Trump is also older than dirt.


## The Economy

Biden's COVID stimulus package was [generous][g20_stimulus_comparison], and he followed it up with a [big infrastructure bill][iija].
All that spending seems to have paid off.
The USA experienced a [smoother post-Covid recovery than other wealthy nations][post_covid_gdp]: lower unemployment, slower inflation, and faster GDP growth.
[Wages are rising][wage_growth], especially for [low-income workers][low_income_wages]. 
Income inequality is [falling][income_inequality_falling]. 

That all said, it's easy to give the president [too much credit][potus_economy] for the economy.
Markets crashed in 2020 because of COVID, not because of Trump.

Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, WHO, UN HRC
Trump updated NAFTA
China tarriffs (resulting an agricultural costs)


## Labor and Unions

Biden is strongly pro-union. 
His NLRB appointees have made it [easier for workers to organize][nlrb]. 
He secured paid leave for rail workers.
Union membership is up, and 2023 was the biggest year for strikes in decades.
