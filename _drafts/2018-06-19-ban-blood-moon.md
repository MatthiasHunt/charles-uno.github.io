# Blood Moon is a format staple

Mardu maindecks 2-3 of them, and is one of the top five decks right now. Ponza and Blue Moon are also in the top twenty. 

That means Blood Moon probably sees about as much play as Tarmogoyf, Aether Vial, Cryptic Command, and Thalia. It's not a fringe card. 


# Blood Moon combos with itself. 

It would be far less egregious if it turned nonbasics into plains, since white is allowed to deal with enchantments. 

This is why nobody cares about Magus of the Moon -- you can just Bolt him. 

It forms a soft lock, often on turn 2. 


# Basic lands aren't good enough for Modern

And that's ok! Basic lands are boring! Blizzard was on to something when they pulled the lands out of the deck for Hearthstone. Now all the cards do something.
