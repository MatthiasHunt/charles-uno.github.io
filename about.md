Welcome!

I'm Charles.
I like figuring out how things work --- and how they could be tweaked to work a little bit better.
My background is in [plasma physics](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/181780), and I currently work as a software engineer at Instagram.

This site is, in part, a portfolio.
I use it to show off content I've created and projects I'm proud of.
It's also, in part, a sandbox.
Sometimes my web development skills are just good enough to make a mess out of it.

The site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Some images are mine.
