Welcome!

I'm Charles. I like figuring out how things work -- and how they could be tweaked to work a little bit better. My background is in [space physics](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/181780), and my day job involves playing with [supercomputers](http://www.cray.com/).

This is my blog/portfolio/sandbox. I show off content I've created, and project I'm proud of. I try to keep the site looking presentable, but no promises... sometimes my web development skills are *just* good enough to make a mess out of everything.
