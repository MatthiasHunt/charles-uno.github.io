Half of all conceptions are naturally aborted, usually before the woman even knows she's pregnant. If anyone truly believed life begins at conception, there would be resources here.

Catholic church tolerates abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy. Fetus grows in the fallopian tube instead of the womb. Dangerous for both -- but there are recorded cases of both surviving birth. Scholarly tradition. They have to admit that biology is complicated.
