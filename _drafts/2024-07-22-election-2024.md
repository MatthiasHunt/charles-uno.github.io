Democrats are running Vice President Harris for president in 2024.
She's been by President Biden's side for the last four years and is his [hand-picked][biden_endorses_harris] successor.
Republicans are running former President Trump, who held the office from 2017 to 2021.
It's unusual to have a presidential election where both[^third_parties] candidates already know their way around the White House. 
This means we have the rare opportunity to make an apples-to-apples[^apples_to_apples_comparison] comparison between them. 
Skip the campaign drama and cheap promises. 
Skip the pearl-clutching[^crimes] about tweets and crimes. 
Between the current administration and the former, who did the job better?

[^apples_to_apples_comparison]: Non-incumbent presidential candidates are typically senators or governors. Senators know about federal lawmaking, but lack executive experience. Governors have executive experience, but it's at the state level rather than federal. That

[^third_parties]: Under a parliamentary system, like in the UK, there can be three or more viable political parties. They form coalitions to create a majority government. The Electoral College makes that nearly impossible in the USA. Credible politicians here stick to the two major parties, and third parties are a joke. For example, despite 30+ years of attempts, the Green Party has [never won any election][green_officeholders] for state or federal office. Jill Stein, the Green candidate for president, has a laughably weak résumé: she served one-and-a-half terms on city council. 

[^crimes]: [Trump was convicted][trump_conviction] of business fraud after leaving office. Not ideal, obviously, but history shows that sometimes a slimeball can be an effective president. Just look at [LBJ][lbj_slimeball] or [Bill Clinton][clinton_slimeball]. Better to judge Trump by the performance of his administration.

To be clear: this is a big question. 
The president runs a million-person bureaucracy, commands the most powerful military in history, sets the legislative agenda, and more. 
Each dimension of the job is important in its own way.
Cherry-picking wins and losses just doesn't do it justice. 

So let's be systematic. 
Below, we've broken down presidential responsibilities into a handful of categories. 
For each category, we can lay out a few of the most impactful policies of each administration. 
This will allow us to judge not only the priorities of each administration, but also how effective it was at getting them done.

## COVID Response

**When the nation is shaken by a crisis, Americans look to the president for leadership and competence. Past presidents have been defined by their response of war, depression, and terrorism. The Trump and Biden/Harris administrations were faced with the worst pandemic in a century plus a global economic crisis.**

The federal government under Trump took COVID seriously. 
Trump personally did not. 
His inability to keep his mouth shut led to thousands of preventable American deaths. 

- Leaders in Congress negotiated $3,200 billion in spending for [vaccine development][trump_covid_vaccine_development], [paid leave][trump_covid_paid_leave], and [direct][trump_stimulus] [support][trump_additional_stimulus] for Americans and businesses. The vaccine program in particular was an incredible success, saving an estimated [140,000 American lives][warp_speed_impact]. Trump was seemingly not involved in the negotiations, and even [threatened][trump_covid_relief_veto_threat] not to sign them.
- Trump also [undercut][trump_covid_mismanagement_analysis] the US pandemic response. He [downplayed][trump_downplayed_covid] the severity of the virus, [contradicted][trump_contradicts_officials] public health officials, and elevated [anti-vaccine conspiracy theories][trump_antivax_tweets]. The COVID death rate in the US was very high compared to other wealthy nations, especially in [pro-Trump areas][covid_death_partisan_gap]. The estimated impact is between [70,000][covid_death_partisan_gap] and [150,000][trump_covid_mismanagement_impact] preventable American deaths. 
- On top of that, Trump impeded COVID response globally. He withdrew US membership from the [World Health Organization][trump_who] during the pandemic, along with billions in funding. He also ran a propaganda campaign to [discourage vaccination][trump_covid_propaganda_china] in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

The Biden/Harris administration made COVID an immediate priority upon taking office:

- Democrats [passed][bh_stimulus_bill] an additional $1,900 billion in stimulus spending for vaccine distribution and additional direct payments to Americans. This made pandemic support in the US [more generous][g20_stimulus_comparison] that in most of Europe. Critics [worried][bh_stimulus_concerns] that so much spending would lead to massive inflation. In fact, the US saw a [faster recovery][post_covid_gdp] than any other wealthy nation: lower unemployment, less inflation, and faster GDP growth. [Wages are rising][wage_growth], especially for [low-income workers][low_income_wages]. Income inequality is [falling][income_inequality_falling]. 
- They promised 100 million vaccine doses in the first 100 days in office. Then they did it in [half that time][bh_100m_shots_100_days].
- They distributed 12 COVID tests to each American household, for free, [by mail][covid_tests_by_mail].
- They [donated][global_vaccines] 700 million vaccine doses globally.
- They also issued [official guidance][bh_covid_plan] for schools and workplaces during COVID. In particular, this guidance included recommendations for how and when to relax precautions as the pandemic wound down.

## Domestic Legacy

**The president does not write legislation. But as the head of government, it's their job to set the agenda and work with Congress to get it done. Laws signed by a president can impact Americans for decades after the president leaves office, as can the federal judges they nominate.**

Trump was not particularly effective at working with Congress. 
Like past Republicans, he nominated anti-abortion judges and signed a tax cut for the rich. 
But he had trouble getting traction for his personal priorities, such as infrastructure and a border wall.

- [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act][trump_tax_cuts] --- $1,500 billion tax cut which [mostly benefited the rich][trump_tax_cuts_analysis]. The onset of the pandemic makes it hard to judge the long-term effects, but [similar tax cuts][bush_tax_cut_analysis] in the past have not delivered economic growth. 
- Trump nominated [200+ federal judges][trump_judges_white_male], who will have the power to interpret and strike down laws for decades. His nominations created a conservative supermajority[^rbg] on the Supreme Court, allowing them to [overturn Roe v Wade][dobbs]. This had been a long-term goal of religious conservatives. Abortions are now banned in many states, [even in the case of emergencies][emergency_abortion_post_dobbs]. There has also been some [collateral damage][dobbs_collateral_damage] to non-abortion healthcare.
- [First Step Act][trump_criminal_justice_reform] (bipartisan) --- Criminal justice reform which reduced mandatory minimum sentencing, ended solitary confinement for minors, mandated de-escalation training for correctional officers, and more. This bill also included $0.4 billion for rehabilitation programs to reduce recidivism. Over 3,000 prisoners were released early in the first year. 
- Trump met with leaders in Congress to negotiate an [infrastructure][trump_infrastructure] bill. No such bill was produced.
- Trump faced off with Congress over funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border, resulting in the longest federal [government shutdown][trump_wall_shutdown] in US history. About 400,000 federal employees were [furloughed][shutdown_cost] for over a month. Trump ultimately secured [about][wall_funding_2018] [$5 billion][wall_funding_2019] from Congress. By the end of his term he had built [50 miles of new wall][trump_wall_outcome] of the proposed 1,300 miles. 

[^rbg]: Conservative justices usually time their retirements so that a conservative president can nominate their replacement, and vice versa. For better or worse, this preserves the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court. The court moved right under Trump because liberal justice [RBG][rbg] died and was replaced with a conservative.

There was no such delay when [Hurricane Harvey][hurricane_harvey] struck Texas that same year.
- He signed a bipartisan bill to [loosen banking regulations][trump_bank_deregulation] put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Several banks subsequently made risky investments and [collapsed][bank_failures_2023].

The Biden/Harris administration was very effective at shepherding legislation through Congress. 
They got a big infrastructure bill. 
They got a big climate bill. 
They got a big manufacturing bill.
They got a gun safety bill.
And they got most of that with bipartisan support.

- [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law][bh_infrastructure_bill] (bipartisan) --- $1,200 billion to modernize roads, bridges, public transit, broadband, and so on. This had been a [long-term goal][obama_and_trump_infrastructure] for both parties. 
- [Inflation Reduction Act][ira] --- $500 billion for clean energy, the largest such investment in history. This spending was offset by an [estimated $700 billion][ira_cbo] in corporate tax hikes and IRS crackdowns on wealthy tax cheats. This bill was passed with a very narrow majority. They had to convince a coal baron to [blow up his own career][bh_ira_manchin] to cast the deciding vote.
- [CHIPs and Science Act][bh_chips] (bipartisan) --- $300 billion to strengthen domestic high-tech manufacturing and supply chains. This was, in part, a response to the worldwide chip shortage during COVID. Chip manufacturing in the US has [nearly doubled][chips_impact] as a result.
- [Safer Communities Act][bh_gun_control] (bipartisan) --- $10 billion for school safety, first responders, and crisis intervention programs. This bill also strengthened background checks and red flag rules. This was the first federal gun law in [30 years][gun_control_history]. 
- [Respect for Marriage Act][bh_marriage_bill] (bipartisan) --- Established protections for same-sex and interracial marriages in case the conservative Supreme Court majority overturns the 2015 marriage equality ruling (as they have [threatened][thomas_overturn_marriage] to do).
- [Juneteenth National Independence Day Act][juneteenth] (bipartisan) --- Added the first new federal holiday since 1983. Juneteenth celebrates enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation. 
- Biden/Harris negotiated a bipartisan [immigration reform bill][immigration_bill_2023] to combat drug smuggling and speed up the years-long asylum[^border_asylum] process. Republicans withdrew support for the bill at Trump's request.
- They nominated 200+ federal judges, including [one][bh_scotus] to the Supreme Court. These judges will have the power to interpret and strike down laws for decades. The judges are [mostly women][bh_lots_of_judges]. About half of them have previously worked as civil rights lawyers and public defenders. 

[^border_asylum]: A migrant fleeing violence or persecution can present themselves at the US border and request asylum. A judge will hear their case and, if legitimate, grant them legal entry to the US. The number of asylum requests has [skyrocketed][recent_asylum_increase] in recent years. The system is overloaded. Encampments are popping up on [both][migrant_camp_usa] [sides][migrant_camp_mexico] of the border while applicants wait for months to see a judge. In the long run, reducing the flow of asylum seekers is a matter of addressing the [root causes][bh_border_root_cause] where they're coming from. But we also need to fix the system for those that are already here.

- IRA also capped insulin prices for seniors
- They passed the bipartisan [Electoral Count Reform Act][bh_electoral_reform] with updates and clarifications to the presidential election process. This law closes the loopholes that [Trump attempted to use in 2020 to overturn the election][trump_fake_electors].

Trump's foreign policy was more nativist than any other president in living memory.
He walked away from multinational agreements.
He cut immigration and refugee resettlement.
He made broad use of tariffs to "win" at international trade.
And he supported the aggression of strongmen in Israel and Russia against their neighbors. 

- Trump signed $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to fend off aggression from Russia, but [blocked][trump_ukraine_scandal] its distribution. At Trump's suggestion, Republican legislators also [delayed aid to Ukraine][trump_ukraine_2024] for several months in 2024.
- Trump supported Israel, as all recent presidents have. He even helped [normalize relations][trump_abraham_accords] between Israel and several Arab states. But he also broke [past precedent][gwb_against_settlements_gaza_aid] with his disregard for Palestinian sovereignty. He [withdrew US support][trump_peace_plan] for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. He endorsed further [Israeli settlements][trump_peace_plan] on occupied land. He [halted humanitarian aid][trump_halted_aid] to Palestine. And he officially [recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel][trump_jerusalem][^5]. 
- Trump negotiated [updates to NAFTA][trump_nafta], the trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the USA. Among other changes, it improves working conditions and labor rights in Mexico. These changes will likely help American workers too, since they will no longer need to compete with such low wages. 
- He withdrew the US from [TPP][tpp], a trade deal meant to balance China's influence in the Pacific. He then [imposed broad tariffs][trump_trade_war] on imports from China in an attempt to shrink the US-China trade deficit. Retaliatory tariffs hit agricultural producers hard, necessitating a $28 billion bailout. The [cost][trump_china_trade_war_size] to [American consumers][trump_tariffs_size] was over $350 billion. GDP and job creation were also negatively affected. There was [no lasting impact][trump_trade_war_effects] to US-China trade patterns.
- Trump withdrew US support from the multinational [Iran Nuuclear Deal][trump_iran_deal] and reinstated US sanctions against Iran. These sanctions [destroyed Iran's economy][iran_deal_withdrawal_economy] and drove millions of Iranians into poverty. Iran has since [resumed uranium enrichment][iran_nuclear_material] and tripled its stockpile.
- Trump [negotiated][trump_taliban_negotiations] with the Taliban to set a timetable for American withdrawal from Afghanistan. He released 5,000 imprisoned Taliban fighters, reduced US troop levels from 13,000 to 3,000, and withdrew support from the elected Afghani government.

<!--
- He also imposed narrower tarrifs worldwide, including on our closest allies. 
- He withdrew US support from the [World Health Organization][trump_who] during the COVID pandemic. 
- He removed the US from the the [UN Human Rights Council][trump_un_hrc] and [UNESCO][trump_unesco]. 
- He [threatened to withdraw the US from NATO][trump_nato], but did not follow through.

[^5]: The status of Jerusalem is a long-standing obstacle to peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The city is culturally important to both sides. 

The Biden/Harris administration prioritized multinational coalitions to counter aggression from Russia and China. 
They also attempted to reduce US involvement in the Middle East, with mixed results.

- Biden/Harris led the international response to [Russia's invasion of Ukraine][bh_ukraine_leadership]. He signed [$175 billion][bh_ukraine_aid] in military and humanitarian aid. He also established [clear guardrails][bh_ukraine_guardrails] to prevent direct conflict between nuclear powers.
- They strengthened relationships with [Australia][bh_pacific_australia], [India][bh_pacific_india], [Japan][bh_pacific_japan_korea], [Papua New Guinea][bh_pacific_png], [the Phillipines][bh_pacific_phillipines], and [South Korea][bh_pacific_japan_korea] in order to counter aggressive behavior from China and North Korea. 
- They sent support to Israel after the October 2023 terrorist attack and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza[^4]. They also leveraged the close US-Israel relationship to pursue peace. They talked Israel back from the [water siege of Gaza][gaza_water_siege]. They brokered a [week-long ceasefire][gaza_ceasefire_2023] in November 2023, and are [pursuing another][ceasefire_work_2024]. They have repeatedly urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties, even threatening to [withhold arms][rafah_arms]. They built a [temporary port][gaza_port] off Gaza for faster delivery of humanitarian aid. And they're pushing for [Palestinian statehood][palestinian_statehood] as part of a postwar plan.
- Biden/Harris completed the withdrawal of US forces from [Afghanistan][afghanistan_withdrawal], ending 20 years of occupation. The Taliban attacked during the final stages of the withdrawal, killing 13 American soldiers and toppling the elected Afghani government.
- They all but ended the US [drone war in Yemen][yemen_drone_war]. There have been 4 strikes under the current administration (compared to 100+ under Trump).

## Executive Effectiveness 

**The president leads the executive branch of the federal government, which has over a million employees. They hand-select department heads and sign executive orders to steer priorities. Notably, these orders are often reversed as soon as the president leaves office.**

> TODO: trump blurb

- Trump implemented a policy of [forcibly separating families][family_separation] to deter the flood of asylum seekers at the border. Thousands of children (including infants) were held in federal custody. A judge later ordered Trump to reunite the families, but doing so took years due to poor recordkeeping. The policy was [not effective][family_separation_ineffective] at reducing asylum claims.
- He cut [legal immigration][trump_reduced_legal_immigration] in half, blocking entry to thousands of high-skilled workers and family members of American citizens. He cut [refugee resettlement][usa_refugees_by_year] in half, blocking entry to thousands more displaced by global crises. He completely blocked entry from [Muslim-majority nations][trump_muslim_ban]. 
- Trump made it more difficult to access [food stamps][trump_snap_cuts]. As a result, 700,000 low-income Americans lost benefits.
- Trump made several attempts to [sabotage Obamacare][trump_aca_mandate_repeal] such as ending the individual mandate, defunding the enrollment website, and blocking subsidy payments. The number of uninsured Americans rose by [5 million][usa_uninsured_rate] from 2015 to 2018. 
- He also rolled back Obama-era regulations on [methane emissions][trump_methane_rollback] and [fuel efficiency][trump_car_emission_rollback]. These changes saved businesses an estimated $120 billion in compliance costs. New vehicles in 2026 will average 40 MPG instead of 47 MPG. That's about an extra $100 per vehicle per year in fuel costs.

- The Trump administration reinterpreted a 1995 law that reimbursed student borrowers in the event of [fraud by their college][trump_student_loan_forgiveness]. Congress tried to fix it, but failed to override Trump's veto. Reduces federal loan forgiveness by hundreds of millions of dollars per year.

- Scaled back overtime rule put in place under Obama. Made millions of working-class Americans ineligible for overtime pay. About $1 billion in [lost wages][trump_overtime] per year.

- Trump made the first-ever attempt to [audit the Pentagon][trump_pentagon_audit]. 

- Trump FTC took on [big tech][trump_tech_antitrust]. Biggest antitrust effort in 20+ years. Takes years for this stuff to shake out. Still going. 

- Trump's EPA [refused to implement][trump_toxic_substances] the 2016 Toxic Substanced Control Act. Looked only at chemicals currently being manufactured in large quantities. Not those already here, such as asbestos and lead. 


- Trump blocked Chinese telecom companies from building and selling 5G products in the US. Huawei, ZTE. Also convinced the UK and Australia to follow suit.

- Trump shortened deadlines for environmental reviews of construction projects. Challenged in court. Not clear if it really happened?

- Trump issued guidance on promoting AI, focused on US dominance in AI, guidance on how to regulate it. Supported european efforts to create global standards around AI. 

- Trump weakened CFPB ability to crack down on racial discrimination in home loans. Cut enforcement. Exempted small banks from data requirements for oversight.

[^undocumented_immigrants]: There are about 10 million undocumented immigrants living in the US.

## Constitutional Integrity

**The Constitution lays out the process for elections and the peaceful transfer of power. It's the foundation upon which the entire government is built. The president is sworn to uphold it.**

Trump brazenly and repeatedly put his own political power above his oath to the US Constitution.
His efforts to overturn the 2020 election were particularly chilling. 
If the president has the power to ignore election results, then elections no longer matter.

- Trump [fired][trump_fires_comey] the head of the FBI, seemingly to disrupt an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. A special counsel was appointed to follow up. The resulting [report][mueller_report] did not charge Trump with a crime, but also did not exonerate him. They found numerous contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials. They also showed that Trump repeatedly attempted to exert "undue influence" to disrupt the investigation. Several men were convicted of lying to the FBI and witness tampering. Trump later [pardoned][trump_pardons] them.
- As president, Trump [publicly asked][trump_ukraine_scandal] Ukraine and China to interfere in the 2020 election in his favor. He withheld military aid from Ukraine in an attempt to blackmail them into fabricating dirt on Biden. Several members of the Trump administration have confirmed that the aid was withheld with the express goal of arranging a quid pro quo.
- Trump [baselessly denied][trump_big_lie] the legitimacy of his 2020 election loss, and attempted to overturn the results to remain in power. He called the top election official in Georgia and [pressured him to fabricate votes][ga_sos_call]. He recruited electors in seven states to submit [fraudulent results][trump_fake_electors]. And he [incited a mob][jan_6] to storm the capitol and disrupt the certification of his loss. Had his efforts succeeded, it would have been the end of the republic. Elections are meaningless if the president has the power to ignore them.

Trump's actions were unprecedented in American history.
Biden and Harris have done nothing remotely comparable.

- Obama and Biden left office without incident after Trump won the 2016 election. 
- As president, Biden/Harris passed [updates to the election process][bh_electoral_reform] to close the loopholes Trump attempted to exploit.
- The Biden/Harris administration appointed a [special counsel][bh_special_counsel] to investigate conspiracies around the 2020 election. Trump has been indicted, but the trial is unlikely to complete before the 2024 election.

> TODO: Biden won the Democratic primaries handily, but bowed out before the official nomination. This prompted some calls of foul play. Political parties are private organizations that can nominate candidates however they like. Presidential primaries didn't even exist until the advent of TV

## Summary

Biden/Harris was an effective center-left administration. 
They led the US comparatively smooth COVID recovery. 
They shepherded a slew of bipartisan bills through Congress.
They passed the largest-ever investment in clean energy. 
They ended the 20-year war in Afghanistan.
And they reaffirmed America's commitment to our global allies. 

<!--

Trump governed as a right-wing reactionary. 
He signed a tax cut for the rich and nominated some anti-abortion judges. 
But in many ways, it seemed like he cared less about policy outcomes and more about picking fights. 
He undermined the pandemic response of his own administration.
He blew up multinational agreements on a whim.
He caused the longest federal shutdown in history.
He started, and lost, a trade war with China. 
He engaged in needless cruelty against asylum seekers and their children.
And, worst of all, he brazenly prioritized his own political power over his oath to the Constitution. 

-->

Either Harris or Trump will be president next year.
Please vote to help ensure it's the better one.
