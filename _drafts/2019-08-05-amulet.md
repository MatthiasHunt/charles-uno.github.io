# Arboreal Grazer vs Sakura-Tribe Scout

Scout lets you put lands onto the battlefield at instant speed. This means you can use bounce lands to protect yourself from Field of Ruin, etc, not to mention triggering Bojuka Bog at instant speed. 

Arboreal Grazer is potentially better against "fair" decks. It ramps when it enters the battlefield, so your opponent's removal does no good. And it can soak up some damage from Goblin Guide or Thalia. 

Grazer also does a decent imitation of Elvish Spirit Guide. With an Amulet on the battlefield and a bounce land in hand, you can Grazer (or Pact-Grazer) nets you mana. 

In the first few turns of the game, they perform similarly. I suspect that Scout is better overall -- instant-speed land drops are very powerful -- but Grazer is not so far behind. 

# Explore vs Growth Spiral

Like Scout, Growth Spiral offers instant-speed land drops. The only downside is the mana cost. It turns out that's a *big* downside. In terms of goldfishing, Growth Spiral is about half as effective as Explore.
