When surveyed, most Americans say they would prefer to spend their last days in the comfort of their own homes. But in practice, [the majority die in hospitals](https://palliative.stanford.edu/home-hospice-home-care-of-the-dying-patient/where-do-americans-die/), surrounded by unfamiliar people and machines. Worse still, many who die in hospitals shouldn't be dying at all. [Over 100k](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/09/20/224507654/how-many-die-from-medical-mistakes-in-u-s-hospitals) American lives are lost each year due to medical errors -- unnecessary surgery, incorrect prescription, etc -- which puts these errors among the 10 most [common causes of death](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) in the US, up there with heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.

Medical errors account for a similar death rate in other wealthy nations -- [Canada](http://globalnews.ca/news/3026275/1-in-18-canadian-hospital-patients-experience-harm-from-preventable-errors-study/), the [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/14/avoidable-deaths-nhs-hospitals-study), and [Germany](http://www.upi.com/17000-die-in-Germany-from-medical-errors/52721267847072/) for instance. And yet, it's unheard-of for doctors to face criminal charges for murder or manslaughter.

To be clear, this is a good thing. It should be very difficult for a doctor, doing their job in good faith, to be convicted of a felony. Doctors are routinely faced with life-and-death decisions; if mistakes opened them up to criminal prosecution, we'd quickly find ourselves with understaffed hospitals. Thousands would go to prison; this would be particularly devastating to rural areas, many of which already face [physician shortages](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/01/2016-15678/lists-of-designated-primary-medical-care-mental-health-and-dental-health-professional-shortage-areas). The suicide rate among doctors is [double](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/why-do-doctors-commit-suicide.html) that of the population overall; the constant threat of a murder charge would likely push it even higher. And it's hard to imagine America's best and brightest stepping up to fill all these vacancies -- if doctors are treated like criminals, veterinary medicine suddenly looks much more appealing.

Plus, practicality aside, it would be problematic to punish an individual doctor for the failure of an institution. Suppose I'm a medical student -- but not a great one. I have some misconceptions about how guts are supposed to fit together. But you give me a medical license anyway, hire me as a surgeon, and put a scalpel in my hand. When I inevitably botch an operation, there's blood on your hands as well as mine.

Crucially, shielding doctors from murder charges is only half the story; the other half is ensuring justice for the victims. When a slip of the surgeon's wrist kills or cripples a single parent, perhaps the surgeon isn't a murderer -- but certainly the children have been wronged.

The accepted solution is for victims to take up a [medical malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice_in_the_United_States) lawsuit. This is clearly not ideal. For every dollar paid out for malpractice, [54 cents](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa054479) are spent on administrative expenses. The [cost of malpractice insurance](http://doctorly.org/cost-vs-reward-of-opening-a-medical-private-practice/) can make it difficult for doctors to go into private practice. [Most doctors](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1012370) will be faced with a malpractice suit during their careers, [many of which](https://www.irmi.com/articles/expert-commentary/medical-malpractice-the-high-cost-of-meritless-claims) are frivolous. Despite these flaws, however, the medical malpractice system serves two important functions:

- Compensatory damages are paid to help the family recover.
- Punitive damages are paid as an admission of wrongdoing.

The high cost of medical malpractice puts providers under [constant pressure to improve and reform](http://m.hartfordbusiness.com/article/20140428/PRINTEDITION/304249935/hospitals-battle-medical-malpractice-costs). Hospital workers are increasingly [trained to avoid errors](http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20151122_Medmal_head_here_in_two_lines_of_36_pt.html) -- and studies suggest that these trainings are [effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27549442).

Like doctors, police officers routinely encounter life-and-death decisions. Sometimes they make mistakes, and people die. Unlike doctors, however, police are faced with criminal charges afterwards. This is problematic in two ways.

First, a murder charge against an individual officer does nothing to acknowledge the failures of the institution. In the 2016 shooting of Philando Castile, for example, the transcript suggests Officer Yanez panicked. Who decided he was ready for traffic duty, gave him a gun and a squad car, and sent him out into the night?

Second, when the criminal suit inevitably fails, the victim's family is left with nothing. Even in cases like Castile's, where the officer clearly made a mistake, 







The medical malpractice system is acceptable.





Like doctors, police officers are routinely faced with life-and-death choices. Sometimes they make mistakes, and people die.

Unwilling to ascribe blame to the institution




Like doctors,








Might a similar system work for police officers?

Like doctors, police officers are routinely faced with life-and-death choices. Sometimes they make mistakes, and people die[^1]. The nature of the institution makes it hard to restrict blame to a single officer[^2]. And if we treat police like criminals, our best and brightest will go elsewhere -- a downward spiral of ever-worse policing.

[^1]: It's been noted that police shootings occur in the US [far more often](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries) than in other wealthy countries. That issue, while important, is far too [complicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality_in_the_United_States#Cultural_factors_unique_to_the_United_States) to handle in a footnote. Here, it's sufficient to acknowledge that a significant number of people (about 1k/year) in the US are killed by police.

[^2]: In July 2016, Officer Yanez fatally shot [Philando Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile) during a traffic stop. The [transcript](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/448740/philando-castile-verdict-was-miscarriage-justice) of the encounter suggests that Yanez panicked. Why was he on traffic duty? Who decided he was ready, gave him a gun and a squad car, and sent him out into the night?

To those who pursued criminal charges after the killings of [Michael Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown), [Philando Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile), [Jamar Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Jamar_Clark), and others by police, "malpractice" may seem like a steep compromise. But perhaps it's a compromise worth making. Equating police killings with murder is a politically polarizing take, and one that has had little success in court. A civil suit brought against the institution may be an easier sell -- and thus a quicker path to reform.

Police departments have balked at the price of [body cameras](https://apnews.com/f19d7270535f4202b92de1872278330f/some-police-suspend-body-cameras-or-hold-citing-costs) and [de-escalation training](http://www.apmreports.org/story/2017/05/05/police-de-escalation-training), but those costs are small compared to a wrongful death suit. [Eric Garner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner)'s death was settled out of court for $6M; [Tamir Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Tamir_Rice) was another $6M. If police departments are made financially liable for their mistakes, they'll work a lot harder to reduce their [liability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/for-55-officers-involved-in-fatal-shootings-this-year-it-wasnt-their-first-time/2015/12/22/435cb680-9d04-11e5-a3c5-c77f2cc5a43c_story.html).

**SCRATCH WORK**

A police malpractice system wouldn't send individual officers to prison, but it would push reform. After the death of [Eric Garner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner) in 2014, New York City paid a $6M settlement to his family. [Tamir Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Tamir_Rice)'s death was also settled for $6M.

Police departments complain that body cameras are a waste of money... but what if they bring down the cost of your malpractice insurance?

https://apnews.com/f19d7270535f4202b92de1872278330f/some-police-suspend-body-cameras-or-hold-citing-costs

de-escalation training is also costly

http://www.apmreports.org/story/2017/05/05/police-de-escalation-training

Reducing that liability will become much more pressing if they're forced to take out an insurance policy against it

If that becomes standard, police departments will start carrying malpractice insurance[^3] -- and looking for ways to reduce their liability.

[^3]: At present, liability insurance is sometimes purchased by [individual officers](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-insurance-idUSKCN0WJ2R1).

Police practice includes the use of force, so it makes sense to label misapplication of force as malpractice.

 Police officers are [almost never](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/) indicted, and even a [damning recording](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/448740/philando-castile-verdict-was-miscarriage-justice) of a fatal encounter may not convince a jury to send an officer to prison.

A civil suit brought against the institution may be less politically polarizing, and thus more winnable. "Mistakes were made" is an easier sell than "it was murder."

Many are uncomfortable with the idea of an officer serving time for a mistake on the job

and yet

- Any ruling in favor of the victim is a moral victory
- Verdicts probably drive reform better than protests. On top of the PR, there's economic pressure to reform. Malpractice insurance is expensive!

How could I have known better? I was assessed by experts, and they said I was ready.

in July 2016, officer Yanez panicked after pulling over Philando Castile in Minnesota. He fatally shot a nonviolent, law-abiding man in front of a child.

Why was he in that situation?

Someone higher up the chain told Yanez he was ready for traffic duty. They gave him a gun and a squad car and sent him out into the night. That should never have happened.

Medical doctor is a life-and-death job.

- Emergency response
- High-impact choices
- Frequent use of dangerous tools

3 officers killed during traffic stops in 2016

We trust doctors with our lives

Doesn't really make sense to hold police to the same standards as civilians when it comes to use of deadly force. we entrust police, as emergency responders, with deadly force. sometimes it will be misapplied. in the same way, there's a difference in scrutiny between a doctor prescribing narcotics and a drug dealer dispensing the same drugs.

Challenge -- it's hard to punish the police as an institution because they are publicly funded. You can't cut into their profits like you can with a private hospital. Underfunded police departments become predatory; see the DOJ's report on Ferguson. This seems surmountable -- how do countries with public healthcare handle medical malpractice?

Policing is a dangerous job, but not to the extent you might think. Lower mortality rate than truck drivers, fishers, or pilots. Most deaths are car accidents, not homicides.

Not all interactions need to be life-and-death. Police shouldn't be killing people during traffic stops, just like you shouldn't fear for your life when the doctor is treating your sprained ankle.

Maybe the gun should be in the trunk, instead of at the hip.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/08/22/americas-10-deadliest-jobs-2/#2438ddf3424b

Police officers have a mortality rate of 11 per 100k. That's lower than truck drivers, construction workers, pilots, etc. About half of police deaths are homicides. That's about the same as the murder rate of US cities.

How do nations with government-funded healthcare handle medical malpractice?

https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/why-do-doctors-commit-suicide.html

400 doctors commit suicide each year

https://www.statista.com/statistics/186260/total-doctors-of-medicine-in-the-us-since-1949/

roughly 1M doctors in the US

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_the_United_States

roughly 1M police officers in the US

https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/7/pdfs/04-1038.pdf

only ~10 doctors per year in the US have job-related deaths
